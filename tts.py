In this video, we.ll explore 10 possible causes of spots on nails and what you can do about them. Keep watching to find out more!.  Nutrient deficiencies: .One common reason for spots on nails is a lack of certain nutrients in your diet, such as iron, zinc, and biotin. These nutrients play a crucial role in the health of your nails, and a deficiency can lead to thin, brittle nails with white spots. To prevent this, make sure you.re getting enough of these nutrients in your diet or consider taking a supplement.. Fungal infections: .Another possible cause of spots on nails is a fungal infection. These infections can cause the nail to become discolored, thick, and crumbly, and may produce a foul smell. If you suspect a fungal infection, it.s important to see a healthcare provider for treatment. They may prescribe antifungal medication to clear up the infection.. Psoriasis: .Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can also affect the nails. It causes the nails to become thickened, yellow, and crumbly, and may also cause pitting or spotting. If you have psoriasis, it.s important to work with a dermatologist to manage the condition and keep your nails healthy.. Trauma to the nail: .Injury to the nail or nail bed can also cause spots or discolorations. For example, if you accidentally hit your nail with a hammer or drop something heavy on it, you may see a black or brown spot. In most cases, these spots will grow out with the nail and disappear over time.. Certain medications: .Certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs and birth control pills, can cause changes in the appearance of your nails. If you.re taking a new medication and notice a change in your nails, it.s a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider to see if the medication could be the cause.. Allergic reactions: .An allergic reaction to a product you.re using on your nails, such as nail polish or glue, can cause spots or discolorations. If you suspect an allergic reaction, stop using the product and see a healthcare provider for treatment.. Hormonal changes: .Hormonal changes, such as during pregnancy or menopause, can also affect the health and appearance of your nails. You may notice that your nails are more brittle or that you.re getting more ridges or spots. In most cases, these changes will resolve on their own once your hormones return to normal levels.. Chronic illnesses: .Certain chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and lupus, can also affect the health of your nails. For example, people with diabetes may notice that their nails are more brittle and prone to fungal infections. If you have a chronic illness and are experiencing changes in your nails, it.s a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider.. Aging: .As we age, our nails naturally become thinner and more brittle, which can lead to ridges and spots. To keep your nails healthy as you age, make sure you.re getting enough nutrients and stay hydrated. You can also try using a nail strengthener or moisturizer to help prevent nail problems.."
