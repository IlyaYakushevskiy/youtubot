Topic: Am I the Asshole for not telling my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting? Post: My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.:My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.:Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.:My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.:I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.:My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep my word.:But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.:I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.:Am I the Asshole for not telling him? Topic: Am I the Asshole for not saying anything about the underwear? Post: My 20 year old daughter and her fianc\'e9 are currently staying with us. I love my daughter but she is very difficult and I can\'92t stand her fianc\'e9. I gave them a deadline to move out because I can\'92t take this anymore. :They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife\'92s underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.:She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn\'92t realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.:My daughter burst into tears and won\'92t talk to me. Her fianc\'e9 said we\'92re fucked and left the house but my wife thought it was funny. Topic: Am I the Asshole for not wanting my son to literally be named "John Doe?" Post: So my last name is Doe. It hasn't affected my life much apart from occasionally being called "Dodo" while growing up or friends spelling it "D'Oh" as a joke, and I'm generally pretty neutral about it.:My wife is six months pregnant and wants to name our future son after her grandfather, who died of cancer in September. His name was John. :I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe "John Doe" is his real name. :My wife thinks I'm being an asshole for vetoing a name with a strong family connection and says I'm exaggerating the issues he would face. Am I the Asshole? Topic: Am I the Asshole for kicking out my girlfriend Post: So I have a cat named Raven who's 3 years old.My girlfriend of 2 years moved in with me a few weeks ago and it was clear she didn't like my cat.:I didn't think it was really a big deal until one day I got home and he was just gone. He's not an outdoor cat and he never goes outside. :He was gone for hours and I was worried sick until my buddy came to my house and returned him, saying he found him 2 blocks from my house.:I asked my girlfriend how my cat, who has never tried to go out before ended up that far from my house and she admitted to kicking him out.:I was furious, saying she had no right to kick him out and told her that since she thought she had the power to kick my cat out, I wanted her out of my house by the end of the month.:She cried that she had nowhere to go and that she would have to live on the streets. I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month.:My friends think I'm being too harsh, but my cat could have died because of her and I don't want her trying anything else. Topic:Am I the Asshole for honking at another driver who cut in front of me at a drive thru each time she tries to order Post: This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me. I laid on the horn and tried to block her from cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off. Okay. I\'92m the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day. I just can\'92t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn\'92t simply let this go.Am I the Asshole for this? Topic: Am I the Asshole for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her? Post: I know the title sounds absolutely terrible. My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since "I've been trying to hard to please myself from men". We broke up.The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it.But Am I the Asshole?No. I did not cheat on her.Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after. Topic: Am I the Asshole for
