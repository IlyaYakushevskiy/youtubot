00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,189
Am I the Asshole for Breaking  Up with Him Over His  Hot Dog Habit? I met this amazing
guy a few months
ago

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:12,378
 We hit it
off right away and
had an amazing first
couple of dates

3
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:18,567
 We
started seeing each other
more often, and things
were really good ,
until I noticed something
strange 

4
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:24,756
 :Every time
I went to his
house, he was eating
a hot dog

5
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:30,945
 Just
one hot dog

6
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:37,135
 Every
single time

7
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:43,324
 I couldn't
believe it 

8
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:49,513
 :At
first I tried not
to be too judgmental
, but it got
to a point where
I was getting really
annoyed

9
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:55,702
 I 'd try
to talk to him
while he was eating,
and he'd just be
picking at his hot
dog the whole time

10
00:00:55,702 --> 00:01:01,891
 :I was getting
frustrated, so I eventually
talked to him about
it 

11
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:08,081
 He just
kind of laughed and
said it was no
big deal

12
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:14,270
 So I
broke up with him

13
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,459

:Now friends are telling
me I'm being an
asshole

14
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,648
 Was I out
of line for ending
our relationship just because
he ate a hot
dog every day?
