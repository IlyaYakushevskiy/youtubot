1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,191
Am I the Asshole for 

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:02,270
BLMing my friend's 

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,462
wedding?  So my best 

4
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,937
friend is getting married 

5
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:06,299
in a few weeks, and I'm 

6
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,491
not sure if I was an 

7
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:08,853
asshole for what I did. 

8
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:10,159
We were finalizing the 

9
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,578
seating arrangements for 

10
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,053
the wedding, when I heard 

11
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:14,359
that she was giving an 

12
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,721
extra seat to one of my 

13
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,140
friends from university. 

14
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,559
I asked her why, and she 

15
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,977
said that it was because 

16
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:21,396
he was her "best" friend 

17
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,758
from university. :I was 

18
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:24,177
taken aback and told her 

19
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:25,426
that I felt slighted, 

20
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,788
because I was her "best 

21
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:28,037
friend" and we have a 

22
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,399
much longer history and 

23
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,818
stronger connection. She 

24
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:32,066
said I was just being 

25
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,542
selfish and making things 

26
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,734
up, and that she had 

27
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,096
already invited him. :I 

28
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,401
wasn't budging, so she 

29
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,707
decided to just buy an 

30
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,126
extra seat for my friend 

31
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:41,545
and still give the other 

32
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,020
seat to her "best" friend 

33
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,098
from university. I 

34
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:45,461
consulted with a few of 

35
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:46,936
our mutual friends and we 

36
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:48,242
decided to contact the 

37
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,717
venue and just cancel the 

38
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,796
extra seat she had 

39
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,271
bought. :She's really mad 

40
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,520
at me, but I was just 

41
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,825
trying to stand up for 

42
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,244
myself. Am I the Asshole 

43
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:57,152
for doing this?
