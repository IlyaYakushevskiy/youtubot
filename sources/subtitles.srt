1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
Am I the Asshole for for 

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,168
beeing so talanted and 

3
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:04,752
good in whatever I do.  

4
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:06,402
So I'm a 20 year old guy 

5
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:07,854
and I've had a lot of 

6
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:09,306
luck with pretty much 

7
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,022
whatever I've set my mind 

8
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,474
to. I'm in university 

9
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:13,662
studying computer 

10
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:15,312
science, I'm really good 

11
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,830
at sports, I make some 

12
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,018
money with coding 

13
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,470
projects and whatever 

14
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,922
else I try my hand at 

15
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,572
seems to turn out pretty 

16
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,222
successful. :The problem 

17
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,872
is twofold. On one hand, 

18
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:27,325
my friends and family 

19
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:28,579
tend to get really 

20
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,229
jealous of me and resent 

21
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,549
my success which is 

22
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,067
really hurtful. On the 

23
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,783
other hand, I find myself 

24
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,169
constantly comparing 

25
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,555
myself to others and 

26
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:39,007
worrying that I'm not 

27
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,525
good enough and that I 

28
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,109
should be doing better, 

29
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,825
much better. I'm kinda in 

30
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,475
a state of paralysis and 

31
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,059
feeling like I can only 

32
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,775
go so far and then it all 

33
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,161
falls apart:Am I the 

34
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,679
Asshole for having too 

35
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,066
much natural talent?
