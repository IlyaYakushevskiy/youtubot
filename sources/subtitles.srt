Am I the Asshole for suspecting my parrot being a nazi sympathizer? Post: So last week I bought a parrot for my living room

2
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:14,191
 My wife thought it was a little silly but I thought it was cute and a nice addition to the family

3
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:21,287
 :But yesterday my wife overheard the parrot cawing and repeating something about "Mein Fuehrer"

4
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:28,383
 I know that's German and I've been watching a lot of '93Hunt for the Red October'94 recently, so I assume it's referring to Hitler

5
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:35,478
 :Today my wife tried to get it to say something else and it responded with "Deutschland Uber Alles"

6
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:42,574
 :I know it's just a parrot and they're known to mimic things they hear, but it's starting to creep me out a little

7
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:49,670
 Should I be worried and get rid of the parrot or am I just overthinking things? Am I the Asshole for suspecting it's a nazi sympathizer?
