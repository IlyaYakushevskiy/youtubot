Am I the asshole for sunshine sha
ming my cousin?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,320
So my cousin and I are very close
.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,120
We both live in different cities,
 but we try to stay in touch as m
uch as possible.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,320
However, lately he's been extreme
ly negative on social media, repl
ying to all posts with

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,160
snarky comments, and seems to be 
intent on ruining everyone's sunn
y days.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,240
I've tried to talk to him about i
t, but he's just brushed it off, 
saying he's just having

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,960
a bad day.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,800
I don't think it's just a bad day
, though.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,080
So today I decided to take matter
s into my own hands and post a pi
cture of the beautiful

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,520
beach by my house, captioning it 
with something about how nice the
 weather is and how grateful

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,040
I am.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,280
He responded with a snarky commen
t, something like, thanks for the
 sunshine shaming.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,040
I felt like he was really overste
pping his boundaries and that he 
was just trying to make

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,320
everyone around him as miserable 
as he is.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,680
Am I the asshole for posting the 
beach picture?
