00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Am I the asshole for volunteer
ing to drive someone home when
 they were too intoxicated to 
drive?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,320
Only to find out they, e2, 80,
 99D been recording me the ent
ire time?

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,600
This happened to me a few week
s ago.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,480
I was out with some friends an
d I noticed a girl who had had
 a few too many drinks.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,400
I offered to drive her home si
nce she was clearly too intoxi
cated to drive.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,360
She accepted my offer, and I d
rove her home.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,520
I made sure she got home safel
y and then I left.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,220
A few days later, I was contac
ted by a friend who had seen a
 video on social media of me

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,680
driving the girl home while sh
e was recording me.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,600
I was shocked.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,280
Not only was it a breach of tr
ust, but there were some prett
y personal conversations

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,040
had between us during the driv
e, which she had cruelly used 
against me.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,640
I confronted her and she denie
d it, but later confessed to h
er crime.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,160
I am still really angry about 
this, and I am wondering if I 
am the asshole for even offeri
ng

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,160
to help in the first place.
