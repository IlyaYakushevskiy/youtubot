00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Am I the asshole for suspecting m
y parrot being a Nazi sympathizer
?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Post.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,160
So last week I bought a parrot fo
r my living room.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,920
My wife thought it was a little s
illy but I thought it was cute an
d a nice addition to

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
the family.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,840
But yesterday my wife overheard t
he parrot calling and repeating s
omething about, mine

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,840
furor.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,360
I know that's German and I've bee
n watching a lot of, 93 hunt for 
the red October, 94

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,440
recently, so I assume it's referr
ing to Hitler.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,040
Today my wife tried to get it to 
say something else and it respond
ed with, Deutsche Land

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,880
Uber Alice.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
I know it's just a parrot and the
y're known to mimic things they h
ear, but it's starting

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,920
to creep me out a little.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Should I be worried and get rid o
f the parrot or am I just overthi
nking things?

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:01:15,480
Am I the asshole for suspecting i
t's a Nazi sympathizer?
