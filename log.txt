2023-02-12 12:54:17,393:Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do Post: So there I was, living my ordinary life as a popular high school student. I'm very good in whatever I do, from sports to schoolwork, and even in organizing parties. Everyone seems to love me, and I'm having a great day. :But then, somthing happened. One of my classmates decided to spread rumors about me, saying that I'm the most arrogant person he's ever met and that I think I'm better than everyone else. This made my popularity plummet, and I was suddenly seen as a villain who's sucking up all the attention.That's when I realized :I'm lucky to be born with talent, but it's also my curse, because people think I'm cocky and arrogant just because I'm good at what I do. :Am I the Asshole for being so talented and good in whatever I do?
2023-02-12 12:58:47,725:Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do. Post: So I'm a 20 year old guy and I've had a lot of luck with pretty much whatever I've set my mind to. I'm in university studying computer science, I'm really good at sports, I make some money with coding projects and whatever else I try my hand at seems to turn out pretty successful. :The problem is twofold. On one hand, my friends and family tend to get really jealous of me and resent my success which is really hurtful. On the other hand, I find myself constantly comparing myself to others and worrying that I'm not good enough and that I should be doing better, much better. I'm kinda in a state of paralysis and feeling like I can only go so far and then it all falls apart:Am I the Asshole for having too much natural talent?
2023-02-12 13:00:06,921:Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool. Post: I've been friends with this girl for about 5 years. She's pretty cool and funny, so it's been a great friendship. Recently, I've started to become increasingly popular. We still hang out but she's also often made comments when we hang with other people that can be taken as negative. :I don't think she realized how popular I'm becoming. She's often left out of the talks and often lines up at the bar without me. I'm not sure how to handle it as I feel like a dick for leaving her behind, but I also don't want to put a dampener on the good times. :She's never said anything directly but I can tell she's hurt and frustrated. Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool?
2023-02-12 13:07:58,026: So my friend and I were out for lunch when he decides to take out his phone and start recording. I didn't know and kept talking but then noticed he was recording me. I asked him why he was and he laughed and said it was funny. :I got mad, grabbed his phone and smashed it on the ground. He got angry with me and said he's gonna report me to the police.My friend said I was out of line and amassing his property which I destroyed. He even said he can call the police. :So am I the asshole here?
2023-02-12 13:11:02,540:Am I the Asshole for playing with my child's toys that he doesn't play with anymore?  My six year old son has an obsession with collecting toys, but he cannot keep them organized and they end up in a huge pile. I have asked him to clean up his toys many times but he doesn't, and I am not going to force him to do so.:Sometimes I find myself playing with his toys, mainly the ones that are hidden in the pile because he doesn't play with them anymore. I find it fun and it helps pass the time when I'm bored. :He sees me playing with his toys and gets mad, saying that he wanted to play with those toys and I should leave them alone. :I tell him that he hasn't played with the toys in a long time and he should organize his toys if he wanted to play with them. :Am I the asshole for playing with my son's toys?




2023-02-12 13:48:27,849:Am I the Asshole for treating my cat as my child?  My cat is my life. He's my best friend, my confidant, and my companion. I talk to him like he's my son, I buy him presents, and I make sure he has plenty of food and water. Everyone who knows me knows how important my cat is to me. Everyone, that is, except for my family. :My family thinks I'm crazy for treating my cat like a child. They think I'm wasting money on my cat, but all I want is for him to be happy. They make jokes about me, but I've just been ignoring them.:The other day, my family had a gathering and, as usual, they were talking about me and my cat. I couldn't take it anymore and I blew up, berating them for not respecting me and my cat. I left the gathering shortly after. But now I'm thinking, was I the asshole for acting the way I did?

2023-02-15 14:25:56,311:Am I the Asshole for apple picking in the same place every year?  I am a big fan of apple picking and have been doing it for years. I enjoy the atmosphere, the fresh apples, and the sense of accomplishment I get from completing my task. I usually go to the same apple orchard every year and end up spending a good chunk of money to fill up my basket. :One year, I went to the same orchard with my friends, and after a few hours, the owner came up to us and said that we couldn't pick apples anymore. He said that we had picked enough apples and needed to leave. We were stunned and argued that we had only picked a few apples. He still mentioned that we couldn't pick anymore, so we reluctantly left.:My friends have since mentioned that it is not fair for the owner to kick us out like that and that we should avoid going to the same place again. I feel that if I follow their advice, I would be missing out on a great apple picking experience.Am I the Asshole for going to the same place each year and risking getting kicked out?
2023-02-15 16:09:29,892:Am I the Asshole for Karening my Dad  So my dad has always been kind of a slob. He's not a hoarder or anything like that, but his house is a mess. Dirty dishes piled up in the sink, clothes everywhere, and he's always leaving crumbs and stuff on the couch. I'm so used to it that I don't even notice it anymore, but my friends are always commenting on how gross his house is.:My dad is retired and is home all day, and I think he gets bored. So I got him a robot vacuum and gave it to him as an early Father's Day gift. It's the same model that I have and it's been a life saver. :He was really excited when I gave it to him and thanked me profusely. Then he turned it on and told me I was a "Karen." :At first I was a bit taken aback, but then I started to laugh hysterically. :My dad was so mad that he refused to keep it, so the next day I returned it. But I still don't know if I'm the asshole. Am I?

After some drinks, things got a little out of hand, and I started to want to bring the attention to me. So, without thinking, I started to karaoke. My girlfriend had her iphone in her hand, and I took it and started singing really loud with it, like a microphone. Everyone was laughing, and having a great time. However, my girlfriend was not amused. She was really mad at me and told me to stop. I did and gave her back her phone. She started to cry and went home. Now she's mad at me and won't talk to me. :Did I do something wrong? Is this an asshole move?

We were having a good time singing and drinking and then Jane decided to take the stage and perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Stop Believin\'. :The entire bar was cheering her on and I wanted her to have the best experience possible, so I did the only reasonable course of action: I Karened her! :I ran up and grabbed her from behind and lifted her in the air, singing and cheering with my arms held high. Jane, who had been so confident on stage, suddenly started to panic and demanded to be let go. She seemed really embarrassed after we stepped off the stage and she immediately left.:The next day she sent me a really long text saying how embarrassed she felt and how I should have asked her before I Karened her. Am I the Asshole here?

Last year, he made an absolutely ridiculous "challenge" video and posted it on YouTube. In the video, he is pretending to be an alcoholic trying to make it to class. He goes through wild antics, drinks a beer and a shot, and then attempts to fly away. It's embarrassing, but also really funny. :I showed the video to my family at our last holiday gathering. He wasn't there. My parents, my siblings and some of my extended family were there. Everybody was laughing and making fun of him, which I thought was kind of mean. My brother found out about it later, and he was furious.:Am I the Asshole for showing the video?

He was a huge ass about it, chewed me out for who knows what reason and left. :The next day he came back when I was out and stole my laptop, my guitar and my TV. He also took all of my clothes, furniture and whatever else he could get his hands on. I was livid and called him out on it but he just laughed and acted like it was no big deal. :So, I decided to take some of his stuff - his keys and address book - and destroy them, one by one. I felt like it was the only way I could get some kind of satisfaction. :He eventually got the cops involved and now I'm facing criminal charges. my lawyer said I'll probably get off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, but I'm still worried about the precedent it sets and how it might affect my reputation.:Am I the Asshole for retaliating in this manner?
2023-02-16 12:32:30,182:Am I the Asshole for destroying my sister's hope of marrying a rich man?  My sister is 22 and she has been looking for a rich man to marry ever since she was 18. This is because our parents weren't able to give us all of the luxurious things we wanted as kids, so my sister is determined to marry someone with all the money she can find. :Recently, she found a guy who is apparently loaded and she is obsessed with him, like she is with any other rich guy she would date. She would talk to me about how great and wonderful this man is and how he's the one who will make all of her dreams come true. :I, on the other hand, did some research on this man and found out that he's already married to someone and has been for a few years. :I could have kept this a secret and just let her keep dreaming. But I feel like I'm protecting her and that it's better for her to know that he is not the one. :I told her the truth and she got really angry at me. She says that I destroyed her hope and I'm an asshole for doing so. Am I the asshole for protecting my sister from a man who could ruin her life?
2023-02-16 13:54:08,663:Am I the Asshole for pronouning my friend's genderfluid daughter as male?  My friend recently had a baby and has chosen to genderfluidly raise her daughter. Since their daughter is still very young, she hasn't expressed a preference for pronouns yet.My friend asked me to refer to the child as "she/her" when I talk about her, even though I am not sure why. I know it's important to respect my friend's wishes, but I feel like it is wrong to use pronouns that don't match the baby's gender when they can't even speak yet.I feel like it's unfair to them to enforce a gender identity on them before they can even express their opinion. Am I the asshole for feeling this way and not wanting to use the "she/her" pronouns?

We were finalizing the seating arrangements for the wedding, when I heard that she was giving an extra seat to one of my friends from university. I asked her why, and she said that it was because he was her "best" friend from university. :I was taken aback and told her that I felt slighted, because I was her "best friend" and we have a much longer history and stronger connection. She said I was just being selfish and making things up, and that she had already invited him. :I wasn't budging, so she decided to just buy an extra seat for my friend and still give the other seat to her "best" friend from university. I consulted with a few of our mutual friends and we decided to contact the venue and just cancel the extra seat she had bought. :She's really mad at me, but I was just trying to stand up for myself. Am I the Asshole for doing this?

My wife and I have been dating for a few years now, and each year it seems like I just check off the same few boxes on any given birthday: flowers, dinner, a present, maybe a cake, etc. We always have a nice time, but it's just become so familiar that it's starting to feel old and boring.:This year, I wanted to do something different, something special. I decided to take her out of town for a long weekend as a surprise. We had an amazing time, exploring the area and enjoying the food, but let's just say it wasn't exactly budget-friendly. I know she was happy, but my wallet was a tad lighter when we returned.:Now she's complaining to her friends about how she thinks I'm an asshole for 'not appreciating' the effort I made. I don't think this was necessary at all, but I can understand how she feels. Am I the Asshole for going above and beyond for her birthday this year? Am I the Asshole for overcoming my birthday cliches and going out of my way to make my wifes birthday special?

2023-02-22 14:56:43,687:Am I the Asshole for eating my so-called friend's food  So there's this guy I work with who I've become friends with. We've been friends for almost a year and I really enjoy our friendship. We always joke around and stuff. :The other day, we were working out at the gym and he brought a bag of food with him. He said he got it from the cafeteria and I'm assuming he meant that he didn't pay for it. He said he was going to eat it after we were done working out. I felt so tempted by the food that I couldn't resist taking a few bites of it. :He was mad at me for eating his food but I don't think I did anything wrong since he didn't pay for it. Am I the Asshole?
2023-02-22 15:06:01,174:Am I the Asshole for sunshine-shaming my cousin?  So my cousin and I are very close. We both live in different cities, but we try to stay in touch as much as possible. However, lately he's been extremely negative on social media, replying to all posts with snarky comments, and seems to be intent on ruining everyone's sunny days. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he's just brushed it off, saying he's just having a bad day. I don't think it's just a bad day, though. :So today I decided to take matters into my own hands and post a picture of the beautiful beach by my house, captioning it with something about how nice the weather is and how grateful I am. He responded with a snarky comment, something like "thanks for the sunshine-shaming". I felt like he was really overstepping his boundaries and that he was just trying to make everyone around him as miserable as he is. :Am I the asshole for posting the beach picture?
2023-02-22 20:56:47,067:Am I the Asshole for drinking beer at my friend's wedding?  So my best friend just got married. It was a beautiful wedding, I was even the best man! However I didn't really understand why you can't drink alcohol at weddings. I know a traditional Jewish wedding isn't supposed to have alcohol but it wasn't a Jewish wedding and it was held in a Catholic Church. :Anyways, I decided I wanted to have a beer because honestly it was a long and tiring wedding so I couldn't resist. In the middle of the reception, I got up and snuck out to the bathroom and grabbed a beer from the bar at the back, and chugged it in the stall. When I came back, nobody noticed I was gone. :My friend's family was a bit angry about it. My friend said that she was embarrassed and that I should of respected the church and church traditions. :Am I the asshole for chugging a beer at my friend's wedding?
2023-02-22 22:29:25,452:Am I the Asshole for investigating my mom's boyfriend? My mother recently got a new boyfriend and I'm not happy about it. I barely even know him and they've been together for a few months. I haven't accepted him into the family yet, even though my mom keeps asking me to. :So I decided to do a bit of online snooping and found out that he has a criminal record. Nothing too serious, but he's made some bad decisions in the past. :My mom was obviously furious with me when I asked her about it. She's convinced that I'm being intrusive and that I'm being too harsh on him. She said that everyone deserves a second chance.:Am I the Asshole for trying to investigate my mom's boyfriend?

2023-02-22 22:34:42,502:Am I the Asshole for prosecuting my friend for stealing from me?  I recently caught my friend stealing from me. We were at dinner and I noticed some of my stuff was missing after he had left. I immediately called him and asked him about it and he told me he “wasn’t sure” and he was “going to check”. So I immediately drove to his place and sure enough he had taken my laptop, my watch and some other stuff. He gave it back to me and apologized but then he kept asking me to not prosecute him. I said I would think about it and then he started begging. He said he had a family and it would ruin his life if I pressed charges. I told him I would think about it, but then he started threatening me and telling me if I didn’t let him go he would do something to me. I said he could leave, but I would still prosecute him. So now I’m torn between whether to prosecute or not, but I’m leaning towards yes. So, am I the asshole?

2023-02-22 22:42:32,049:Am I the Asshole for sentencing my husband to 10 hours of "girlfriend time" when I catch him cheating?  My husband has been cheating on me with his ex-girlfriends. I finally caught him in the act when I came home early one day. We argued and I told him I wanted him out right away. He started crying and begged me to give him a chance to make it right. :I was feeling a bit generous so I told him he could stay but he had to do something for me. I told him that I wanted him to spend 10 hours with each of his ex-girlfriends to get closure and to make sure that he won't do it again. :This seemed like the perfect punishment since it will make him feel guilty for his actions and it will also stop him from cheating again. He reluctantly agreed and I had him write a letter to each of his ex-girlfriends telling them that he would like to spend time with them. :He has already spent 6 hours with his first ex-girlfriend and things seem to be going well. I don't know if this is too harsh of a punishment but I just wanted to make sure that he could learn from his mistakes. :Am I the asshole for sentencing him to 10 hours with his ex-girlfriends?
2023-02-22 22:56:19,826:Am I the Asshole for entering my brother when he was  sleeping?  My brother is 7 years old and he has difficulty sleeping at night. A few months ago, I was in his room while he was sleeping, and I decided to prank him by putting a stuffed animal in his bed. :My brother woke up screaming, saying that he saw a monster in his bed. He started crying and said he was afraid to sleep by himself.He even had to sleep with a nightlight. :I felt really bad, so I told my parents what I did. They got really mad and grounded me.My parents said I should have known better and that I broke a basic trust between siblings. :Am I the Asshole for pranking my brother while he was sleeping?

2023-02-22 23:14:39,003:Am I the Asshole for sentencing my roommate to a strict curfew?  My roommate has been living with me for about 6 months now. We get along for the most part, but there is one issue thats been gradually escalating since he moved in. Hes really bad with time management. For instance, if he says hell be home at 8pm, hell come home an hour late without any warning. This has caused a lot of issues as I have to make sure that dinner is ready for him, or else hell just get takeaway late at night. Im a student and this is really disruptive to my studies. :So recently I had had enough, and decided to impose a strict curfew on him. He has to come home by 8pm, otherwise he will be locked out of the house until 8am the next day. :Hes not happy about it and says its not fair. He says Im being an unreasonable roommate. Am I the Asshole for introducing this curfew?

My uncle was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes he committed a few years ago. The laws here are quite strict and people have been known to die in prison, so I pardoned him from his sentence.:My uncle is a very powerful and influential man, and I believe he can still be a force for good in this country. He is elderly, and I think he deserves a second chance, no matter what he has done in the past.:My actions, however, have caused a huge outcry among my people. Theyre saying Im showing favoritism towards someone they consider a war criminal, and that Im sending the message that if youre powerful, you can get away with anything.:Am I the Asshole for pardoning my convicted uncle?

2023-02-22 23:28:01,897:Am I the Asshole for licking my parrots beak?  So, I have a parrot that Ive had for about 5 years now. I love him and I just adore his little beak. Hes always been so well behaved, and I love playing with him and giving him affection. Well, the other day I was playing with him, and it was just so cute when he was licking his beak, I couldnt help but lean in and lick his beak as well. He seemed fine with it, but my wife was horrified and thinks its disgusting and wrong. She said I should never do that again and that I could get a disease or something. :I dont want to put my parrot at risk of anything, but I also dont want to deny him the love and affection he clearly welcomes. Am I the Asshole here?

So my friend, who is a bit of a slacker and doesnt like to do physical activities, asked me to join him for lunch. I said okay and he said hed come to my place since I was busy that day. When he arrived, my brothers were there playing badminton in the backyard. Since he was already there, I suggested that he join them, but he said he didnt want to. My brothers kept insisting, and he finally agreed after much persuasion. :When I came back a few hours later, my friend was still out there, looking miserable and exhausted. My brothers had clearly worn him out with the badminton. He didnt say anything, but I could tell he was a bit angry with me. :Was I wrong to push him into playing badminton with my brothers?

As clichéd as it sounds, it really was true.He broke up with me out of the blue, saying he just wasnt feeling it any more and that he deserved more than what I was offering. Naturally, I was devastated. We talked a few times over the following months and he was always very clear that it was over and that he was moving on, but I couldnt help but plead with him to reconsider.I begged and pleaded and tried to explain my feelings, and he finally blocked me because I couldnt take the hint. I feel like such an idiot, and I know in the months since then I have been pining away for him.Am I the asshole?

I have been desperately looking for a job, but so far I have had no luck. I have already applied for every job I can find in my area, and I am now applying to jobs that are a bit further away. :I have been feeling resentful towards my wife and feeling like she isnt taking responsibility for our finances. I am the only one who is actively trying to make money, while she is sitting in the house with no motivation to do anything. It has been a few months and I feel like she is not understanding how dire our situation is. :This morning I had a discussion with her about our finances and about how I feel like she isnt taking responsibility.

Am I the asshole for making her feel guilty over the medical bills?

I wasnt mad, it was more of a reflex than an actual conscious reaction. I slapped her ass and told her to stop it. She was obviously embarrassed, but I stood my ground and told her that if she wanted to be one of the guys then she had to respect boundaries. :I thought I made my point, but now shes still mad at me and saying that I was wrong to do it - was I the asshole here?

She has done things that I would never expect from her and she has no memories of it. :I dont want her to go through the same things again, so I decided to use our close relationship to make sure she stays away from it. :I took her out for a night, and in the middle of it I non-consensually penetrated her. It lasted for less than a minute, but she was in pain. She didnt realize what was happening at first and then she became shocked when I pulled away and told her what just happened. :She started crying and said she wanted to go home. I was an asshole. Am I?

2023-02-23 01:52:06,149:Am I the Asshole for jurying up a birthday party  So my daughter was turning 16 and wanted to have a big birthday party. I let her invite all of her friends and family to come, but told her that she had to pay for it herself. She was excited about it and started looking for venues and food. :She finally found one that was perfect for her. It was a little expensive, but it was a lot of fun and family friendly. :The day before the party, I found out that my boss was having a retirement party and that he would be paying for it. So I decided to use it as an excuse to take away my daughters party and told her that I had to go to my boss party and that she would have to reschedule hers.:My daughter was obviously very upset and her friends were confused. Her friends had to find a new place to celebrate her birthday and some of them had already spent money on gifts. :Am I the Asshole for jurying up a birthday party?

2023-02-23 01:59:39,417:Am I the Asshole for giving a felony conviction to my ex?  So my ex was arrested for shoplifting a few days ago and I was the one to put the call into the police - they had her on camera taking the items and when they came to question her she was unable to provide a receipt so they charged her with a felony. :She came over to my house to try and convince me to drop the charges and I refused, citing that it was the right thing to do and that I wouldnt be a party to her crime. :She was mad, obviously, and started to call me names and threaten me...so I called the police again and she was arrested for further charges - this time for assaulting an officer.:My ex is now facing serious prison time - she is looking at a minimum of 5 years and I know that Im the one largely to blame for this. :Am I the Asshole for calling the police the second time?

2023-02-23 02:18:35,894:Am I the Asshole for misdemeanor charges?  I was recently arrested for a minor crime. It was a stupid mistake which I regret. Unfortunately, I now have a criminal record with misdemeanor charges.I am trying to move on and get a job, but I am afraid that this may hinder me. I applied to a few places, but I havent been getting calls back. Im starting to think that I should tell people that I do have misdemeanor charges.Im not sure if this is the right thing to do. I dont want to lie, but Im afraid that if I tell them my record, they wont even consider me. Am I the Asshole for even thinking of this?Thanks!

2023-02-23 02:34:11,652:Am I the Asshole for inspiring my friend to try and push himself to the limit?  So I\92m a pretty physically active person. I love pushing myself to the limit, whether it\92s going running, lifting weights, taking a yoga class, or playing some basketball. My best friend, on the other hand, was pretty lazy and content to just sit around playing video games or watching tv. :I, being the inspirational person that I am, decided to try and get him to come with me to the gym or for a run and to try and take him out of his comfort zone. The results were great! He started to really enjoy working out, getting into it and pushing himself and was eventually even able to do more than I could do!:I\92m really proud of him for the progress he\92s made and he\92s really grateful for pushing him out of his comfort zone.:The only problem is that he says that he sometimes pushes himself too far and it scares him and he thinks that maybe I should have encouraged him to slow down and take it easy. :Am I the Asshole for inspiring him to push himself too hard?

Hes not particularly obese, but he has been steadily gaining weight, and its started to show. Ive been trying to motivate him to get active and eat healthier, but he gets extremely sensitive when I do, and its gotten to the point where he shuts down whenever I bring it up. I care about him and I want him to be healthy and happy, but I also dont want to hurt his feelings and make him feel bad about himself. Am I the asshole for pushing him to do something he doesnt want to do, even if its for his own good?

2023-02-23 02:47:09,490:Am I the Asshole for empowering my son to stand up to his bullies  My son is in 5th grade and has been facing some bullying lately. Hes often called names like loser and stupid and has been having a hard time dealing with it. Hes a very timid child and he wont confront his bullies himself because hes afraid of what they could do to him. So I decided to step in and talk to him about standing up for himself where I could.I told him he should find strength in himself and speak up for himself and stand up for himself. I even gave him some tips on how to confront his bullies in a respectful manner.He was very thankful for my support. He went to school the next day, and thats when I realized I made a huge mistake.He ended up getting into a yelling match with his bullies and they got physically violent with him. He didnt end up getting hurt but he was very shaken afterwards.I feel like I empowered my son to stand up to his bullies but ended up making things worse. Am I the asshole here?

2023-02-23 03:00:28,441:Am I the Asshole for uplifting my partner by going to the gym?  Im in a long distance relationship and my partner always tells me how much he hates his body and how hes ashamed of it. Im really into fitness and take my body very seriously. We talk almost every day and he always brings up how hes being judged by others because of his physical shape. :I told him about how going to the gym for an hour a day can really uplift your mood and make you feel super confident. He agreed and asked me to do it with him. But here is where the problem lies: he lives in a different country and I dont. :So I suggested buying the same gym equipment and have him post selfies of us working out together on different days and challenge each other with routines and motivate each other. Hes into it but hes also worried that Im only doing it to uplift him and not myself. :Am I the Asshole for doing this?

2023-02-23 03:07:00,522:Am I the Asshole for fostering a pet and not returning it when it got too needy?  I recently got a pet rabbit.I wanted to try out fostering a pet and see if it was something that I could handle. I was warned by the shelter that this one in particular was a more needy bunny and needed more special attention than your average housepet. I took her in and gave her all the love and attention she needed and more. :But after a few weeks, she started to become overly dependent on me and I couldnt handle it. She started to follow me around constantly and even began licking my feet when I was sleeping. I was getting very little sleep and was starting to feel overwhelmed by her constant need for attention. :I decided to return her to the shelter. I was feeling guilty, but at the same time I knew that I wasnt able to provide the kind of care that this animal needed. :When I returned her to the shelter, the staff gave me a lot of criticism for bringing her back and said that I was being irresponsible. :Am I the asshole for fostering a pet and not returning it when it became too needy?

2023-02-23 03:15:39,849:Am I the Asshole for supporting my friend in leaving her abusive relationship?  My best friend has been in an abusive relationship for about six months now. Her partner has verbally and physically abused her, manipulated her, threatened her, and isolated her from her friends and family. I had been trying to talk her into leaving him, but she always defended him, saying he had his moments but he really loved her. :Recently, he kicked her out of their apartment and she asked me if she could stay with me for a few days until she figured things out. I welcomed her with open arms and let her stay as long as she needed to. I gave her a hug and told her that I was here for her no matter what. :After a few days, I learned that she was talking to him again and considering going back. After talking to her and supporting her, she finally decided to leave him for good, and Im so proud and happy for her. :But some of my friends think that Im the asshole for encouraging her to leave her abusive partner. They think I was wrong to interfere and support her, and that I should have minded my own business and just let her go back. Am I the Asshole?

This happened to me a few weeks ago. I was out with some friends and I noticed a girl who had had a few too many drinks. I offered to drive her home since she was clearly too intoxicated to drive. She accepted my offer, and I drove her home. I made sure she got home safely and then I left. A few days later, I was contacted by a friend who had seen a video on social media of me driving the girl home while she was recording me.:I was shocked. Not only was it a breach of trust, but there were some pretty personal conversations had between us during the drive, which she had cruelly used against me.I confronted her and she denied it, but later confessed to her crime.Im still really angry about this, and Im wondering if Im the Asshole for even offering to help in the first place.
