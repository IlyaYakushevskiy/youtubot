2023-02-12 12:54:17,393:Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do Post: So there I was, living my ordinary life as a popular high school student. I'm very good in whatever I do, from sports to schoolwork, and even in organizing parties. Everyone seems to love me, and I'm having a great day. :But then, somthing happened. One of my classmates decided to spread rumors about me, saying that I'm the most arrogant person he's ever met and that I think I'm better than everyone else. This made my popularity plummet, and I was suddenly seen as a villain who's sucking up all the attention.That's when I realized :I'm lucky to be born with talent, but it's also my curse, because people think I'm cocky and arrogant just because I'm good at what I do. :Am I the Asshole for being so talented and good in whatever I do?
2023-02-12 12:58:47,725:Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do. Post: So I'm a 20 year old guy and I've had a lot of luck with pretty much whatever I've set my mind to. I'm in university studying computer science, I'm really good at sports, I make some money with coding projects and whatever else I try my hand at seems to turn out pretty successful. :The problem is twofold. On one hand, my friends and family tend to get really jealous of me and resent my success which is really hurtful. On the other hand, I find myself constantly comparing myself to others and worrying that I'm not good enough and that I should be doing better, much better. I'm kinda in a state of paralysis and feeling like I can only go so far and then it all falls apart:Am I the Asshole for having too much natural talent?
2023-02-12 13:00:06,921:Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool. Post: I've been friends with this girl for about 5 years. She's pretty cool and funny, so it's been a great friendship. Recently, I've started to become increasingly popular. We still hang out but she's also often made comments when we hang with other people that can be taken as negative. :I don't think she realized how popular I'm becoming. She's often left out of the talks and often lines up at the bar without me. I'm not sure how to handle it as I feel like a dick for leaving her behind, but I also don't want to put a dampener on the good times. :She's never said anything directly but I can tell she's hurt and frustrated. Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool?
2023-02-12 13:07:58,026: So my friend and I were out for lunch when he decides to take out his phone and start recording. I didn't know and kept talking but then noticed he was recording me. I asked him why he was and he laughed and said it was funny. :I got mad, grabbed his phone and smashed it on the ground. He got angry with me and said he's gonna report me to the police.My friend said I was out of line and amassing his property which I destroyed. He even said he can call the police. :So am I the asshole here?
2023-02-12 13:11:02,540:Am I the Asshole for playing with my child's toys that he doesn't play with anymore?  My six year old son has an obsession with collecting toys, but he cannot keep them organized and they end up in a huge pile. I have asked him to clean up his toys many times but he doesn't, and I am not going to force him to do so.:Sometimes I find myself playing with his toys, mainly the ones that are hidden in the pile because he doesn't play with them anymore. I find it fun and it helps pass the time when I'm bored. :He sees me playing with his toys and gets mad, saying that he wanted to play with those toys and I should leave them alone. :I tell him that he hasn't played with the toys in a long time and he should organize his toys if he wanted to play with them. :Am I the asshole for playing with my son's toys?




2023-02-12 13:48:27,849:Am I the Asshole for treating my cat as my child?  My cat is my life. He's my best friend, my confidant, and my companion. I talk to him like he's my son, I buy him presents, and I make sure he has plenty of food and water. Everyone who knows me knows how important my cat is to me. Everyone, that is, except for my family. :My family thinks I'm crazy for treating my cat like a child. They think I'm wasting money on my cat, but all I want is for him to be happy. They make jokes about me, but I've just been ignoring them.:The other day, my family had a gathering and, as usual, they were talking about me and my cat. I couldn't take it anymore and I blew up, berating them for not respecting me and my cat. I left the gathering shortly after. But now I'm thinking, was I the asshole for acting the way I did?

2023-02-15 14:25:56,311:Am I the Asshole for apple picking in the same place every year?  I am a big fan of apple picking and have been doing it for years. I enjoy the atmosphere, the fresh apples, and the sense of accomplishment I get from completing my task. I usually go to the same apple orchard every year and end up spending a good chunk of money to fill up my basket. :One year, I went to the same orchard with my friends, and after a few hours, the owner came up to us and said that we couldn't pick apples anymore. He said that we had picked enough apples and needed to leave. We were stunned and argued that we had only picked a few apples. He still mentioned that we couldn't pick anymore, so we reluctantly left.:My friends have since mentioned that it is not fair for the owner to kick us out like that and that we should avoid going to the same place again. I feel that if I follow their advice, I would be missing out on a great apple picking experience.Am I the Asshole for going to the same place each year and risking getting kicked out?
2023-02-15 16:09:29,892:Am I the Asshole for Karening my Dad  So my dad has always been kind of a slob. He's not a hoarder or anything like that, but his house is a mess. Dirty dishes piled up in the sink, clothes everywhere, and he's always leaving crumbs and stuff on the couch. I'm so used to it that I don't even notice it anymore, but my friends are always commenting on how gross his house is.:My dad is retired and is home all day, and I think he gets bored. So I got him a robot vacuum and gave it to him as an early Father's Day gift. It's the same model that I have and it's been a life saver. :He was really excited when I gave it to him and thanked me profusely. Then he turned it on and told me I was a "Karen." :At first I was a bit taken aback, but then I started to laugh hysterically. :My dad was so mad that he refused to keep it, so the next day I returned it. But I still don't know if I'm the asshole. Am I?

After some drinks, things got a little out of hand, and I started to want to bring the attention to me. So, without thinking, I started to karaoke. My girlfriend had her iphone in her hand, and I took it and started singing really loud with it, like a microphone. Everyone was laughing, and having a great time. However, my girlfriend was not amused. She was really mad at me and told me to stop. I did and gave her back her phone. She started to cry and went home. Now she's mad at me and won't talk to me. :Did I do something wrong? Is this an asshole move?

We were having a good time singing and drinking and then Jane decided to take the stage and perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Stop Believin\'. :The entire bar was cheering her on and I wanted her to have the best experience possible, so I did the only reasonable course of action: I Karened her! :I ran up and grabbed her from behind and lifted her in the air, singing and cheering with my arms held high. Jane, who had been so confident on stage, suddenly started to panic and demanded to be let go. She seemed really embarrassed after we stepped off the stage and she immediately left.:The next day she sent me a really long text saying how embarrassed she felt and how I should have asked her before I Karened her. Am I the Asshole here?

Last year, he made an absolutely ridiculous "challenge" video and posted it on YouTube. In the video, he is pretending to be an alcoholic trying to make it to class. He goes through wild antics, drinks a beer and a shot, and then attempts to fly away. It's embarrassing, but also really funny. :I showed the video to my family at our last holiday gathering. He wasn't there. My parents, my siblings and some of my extended family were there. Everybody was laughing and making fun of him, which I thought was kind of mean. My brother found out about it later, and he was furious.:Am I the Asshole for showing the video?

He was a huge ass about it, chewed me out for who knows what reason and left. :The next day he came back when I was out and stole my laptop, my guitar and my TV. He also took all of my clothes, furniture and whatever else he could get his hands on. I was livid and called him out on it but he just laughed and acted like it was no big deal. :So, I decided to take some of his stuff - his keys and address book - and destroy them, one by one. I felt like it was the only way I could get some kind of satisfaction. :He eventually got the cops involved and now I'm facing criminal charges. my lawyer said I'll probably get off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, but I'm still worried about the precedent it sets and how it might affect my reputation.:Am I the Asshole for retaliating in this manner?
2023-02-16 12:32:30,182:Am I the Asshole for destroying my sister's hope of marrying a rich man?  My sister is 22 and she has been looking for a rich man to marry ever since she was 18. This is because our parents weren't able to give us all of the luxurious things we wanted as kids, so my sister is determined to marry someone with all the money she can find. :Recently, she found a guy who is apparently loaded and she is obsessed with him, like she is with any other rich guy she would date. She would talk to me about how great and wonderful this man is and how he's the one who will make all of her dreams come true. :I, on the other hand, did some research on this man and found out that he's already married to someone and has been for a few years. :I could have kept this a secret and just let her keep dreaming. But I feel like I'm protecting her and that it's better for her to know that he is not the one. :I told her the truth and she got really angry at me. She says that I destroyed her hope and I'm an asshole for doing so. Am I the asshole for protecting my sister from a man who could ruin her life?
2023-02-16 13:54:08,663:Am I the Asshole for pronouning my friend's genderfluid daughter as male?  My friend recently had a baby and has chosen to genderfluidly raise her daughter. Since their daughter is still very young, she hasn't expressed a preference for pronouns yet.My friend asked me to refer to the child as "she/her" when I talk about her, even though I am not sure why. I know it's important to respect my friend's wishes, but I feel like it is wrong to use pronouns that don't match the baby's gender when they can't even speak yet.I feel like it's unfair to them to enforce a gender identity on them before they can even express their opinion. Am I the asshole for feeling this way and not wanting to use the "she/her" pronouns?
2023-02-16 14:42:50,666:Am I the Asshole for BLMing my friend's wedding?  So my best friend is getting married in a few weeks, and I'm not sure if I was an asshole for what I did. We were finalizing the seating arrangements for the wedding, when I heard that she was giving an extra seat to one of my friends from university. I asked her why, and she said that it was because he was her "best" friend from university. :I was taken aback and told her that I felt slighted, because I was her "best friend" and we have a much longer history and stronger connection. She said I was just being selfish and making things up, and that she had already invited him. :I wasn't budging, so she decided to just buy an extra seat for my friend and still give the other seat to her "best" friend from university. I consulted with a few of our mutual friends and we decided to contact the venue and just cancel the extra seat she had bought. :She's really mad at me, but I was just trying to stand up for myself. Am I the Asshole for doing this?
