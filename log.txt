2023-02-12 12:54:17,393:Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do Post: So there I was, living my ordinary life as a popular high school student. I'm very good in whatever I do, from sports to schoolwork, and even in organizing parties. Everyone seems to love me, and I'm having a great day. :But then, somthing happened. One of my classmates decided to spread rumors about me, saying that I'm the most arrogant person he's ever met and that I think I'm better than everyone else. This made my popularity plummet, and I was suddenly seen as a villain who's sucking up all the attention.That's when I realized :I'm lucky to be born with talent, but it's also my curse, because people think I'm cocky and arrogant just because I'm good at what I do. :Am I the Asshole for being so talented and good in whatever I do?

I'm in university studying computer science, I'm really good at sports, I make some money with coding projects and whatever else I try my hand at seems to turn out pretty successful. :The problem is twofold. On one hand, my friends and family tend to get really jealous of me and resent my success which is really hurtful. On the other hand, I find myself constantly comparing myself to others and worrying that I'm not good enough and that I should be doing better, much better. I'm kinda in a state of paralysis and feeling like I can only go so far and then it all falls apart:Am I the Asshole for having too much natural talent?
2023-02-12 13:00:06,921:Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool. Post: I've been friends with this girl for about 5 years. She's pretty cool and funny, so it's been a great friendship. Recently, I've started to become increasingly popular. We still hang out but she's also often made comments when we hang with other people that can be taken as negative. :I don't think she realized how popular I'm becoming. She's often left out of the talks and often lines up at the bar without me. I'm not sure how to handle it as I feel like a dick for leaving her behind, but I also don't want to put a dampener on the good times. :She's never said anything directly but I can tell she's hurt and frustrated. Am I the Asshole for being so goddamn cool?
2023-02-12 13:07:58,026: So my friend and I were out for lunch when he decides to take out his phone and start recording. I didn't know and kept talking but then noticed he was recording me. I asked him why he was and he laughed and said it was funny. :I got mad, grabbed his phone and smashed it on the ground. He got angry with me and said he's gonna report me to the police.My friend said I was out of line and amassing his property which I destroyed. He even said he can call the police. :So am I the asshole here?
2023-02-12 13:11:02,540:Am I the Asshole for playing with my child's toys that he doesn't play with anymore?  My six year old son has an obsession with collecting toys, but he cannot keep them organized and they end up in a huge pile. I have asked him to clean up his toys many times but he doesn't, and I am not going to force him to do so.:Sometimes I find myself playing with his toys, mainly the ones that are hidden in the pile because he doesn't play with them anymore. I find it fun and it helps pass the time when I'm bored. :He sees me playing with his toys and gets mad, saying that he wanted to play with those toys and I should leave them alone. :I tell him that he hasn't played with the toys in a long time and he should organize his toys if he wanted to play with them. :Am I the asshole for playing with my son's toys?




2023-02-12 13:48:27,849:Am I the Asshole for treating my cat as my child?  My cat is my life. He's my best friend, my confidant, and my companion. I talk to him like he's my son, I buy him presents, and I make sure he has plenty of food and water. Everyone who knows me knows how important my cat is to me. Everyone, that is, except for my family. :My family thinks I'm crazy for treating my cat like a child. They think I'm wasting money on my cat, but all I want is for him to be happy. They make jokes about me, but I've just been ignoring them.:The other day, my family had a gathering and, as usual, they were talking about me and my cat. I couldn't take it anymore and I blew up, berating them for not respecting me and my cat. I left the gathering shortly after. But now I'm thinking, was I the asshole for acting the way I did?

2023-02-12 14:40:14,088:Am I the Asshole for Breaking Up with Him Over His Hot Dog Habit?  I met this amazing guy a few months ago. We hit it off right away and had an amazing first couple of dates. We started seeing each other more often, and things were really good, until I noticed something strange. :Every time I went to his house, he was eating a hot dog. Just one hot dog. Every single time. I couldn't believe it. :At first I tried not to be too judgmental, but it got to a point where I was getting really annoyed. I'd try to talk to him while he was eating, and he'd just be picking at his hot dog the whole time. :I was getting frustrated, so I eventually talked to him about it. He just kind of laughed and said it was no big deal. So I broke up with him. :Now friends are telling me I'm being an asshole. Was I out of line for ending our relationship just because he ate a hot dog every day?
