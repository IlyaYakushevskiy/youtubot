Am I the Asshole for sunshine-shaming my cousin?  So my cousin and I are very close. We both live in different cities, but we try to stay in touch as much as possible. However, lately he's been extremely negative on social media, replying to all posts with snarky comments, and seems to be intent on ruining everyone's sunny days. I've tried to talk to him about it, but he's just brushed it off, saying he's just having a bad day. I don't think it's just a bad day, though. :So today I decided to take matters into my own hands and post a picture of the beautiful beach by my house, captioning it with something about how nice the weather is and how grateful I am. He responded with a snarky comment, something like "thanks for the sunshine-shaming". I felt like he was really overstepping his boundaries and that he was just trying to make everyone around him as miserable as he is. :Am I the asshole for posting the beach picture?
