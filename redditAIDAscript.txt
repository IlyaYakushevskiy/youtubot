Am I the Asshole for volunteering to drive someone home when they were too intoxicated to drive, only to find out they\e2\80\99d been recording me the entire time?  This happened to me a few weeks ago. I was out with some friends and I noticed a girl who had had a few too many drinks. I offered to drive her home since she was clearly too intoxicated to drive. She accepted my offer, and I drove her home. I made sure she got home safely and then I left. A few days later, I was contacted by a friend who had seen a video on social media of me driving the girl home while she was recording me.:I was shocked. Not only was it a breach of trust, but there were some pretty personal conversations had between us during the drive, which she had cruelly used against me.I confronted her and she denied it, but later confessed to her crime.Im still really angry about this, and Im wondering if Im the Asshole for even offering to help in the first place.
