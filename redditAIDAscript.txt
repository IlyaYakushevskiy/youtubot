Am I the Asshole for suspecting my parrot being a nazi sympathizer? Post: So last week I bought a parrot for my living room. My wife thought it was a little silly but I thought it was cute and a nice addition to the family. :But yesterday my wife overheard the parrot cawing and repeating something about "Mein Fuehrer". I know that's German and I've been watching a lot of '93Hunt for the Red October'94 recently, so I assume it's referring to Hitler. :Today my wife tried to get it to say something else and it responded with "Deutschland Uber Alles". :I know it's just a parrot and they're known to mimic things they hear, but it's starting to creep me out a little. Should I be worried and get rid of the parrot or am I just overthinking things? Am I the Asshole for suspecting it's a nazi sympathizer?
