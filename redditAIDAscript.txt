Am I the Asshole for for beeing so talanted and good in whatever I do.  So I'm a 20 year old guy and I've had a lot of luck with pretty much whatever I've set my mind to. I'm in university studying computer science, I'm really good at sports, I make some money with coding projects and whatever else I try my hand at seems to turn out pretty successful. :The problem is twofold. On one hand, my friends and family tend to get really jealous of me and resent my success which is really hurtful. On the other hand, I find myself constantly comparing myself to others and worrying that I'm not good enough and that I should be doing better, much better. I'm kinda in a state of paralysis and feeling like I can only go so far and then it all falls apart:Am I the Asshole for having too much natural talent?
