Am I the Asshole for Breaking  Up with Him Over His  Hot Dog Habit? I met this amazing
guy a few months
ago. We hit it
off right away and
had an amazing first
couple of dates. We
started seeing each other
more often, and things
were really good ,
until I noticed something
strange . :Every time
I went to his
house, he was eating
a hot dog. Just
one hot dog. Every
single time. I couldn't
believe it . :At
first I tried not
to be too judgmental
, but it got
to a point where
I was getting really
annoyed. I 'd try
to talk to him
while he was eating,
and he'd just be
picking at his hot
dog the whole time
. :I was getting
frustrated, so I eventually
talked to him about
it . He just
kind of laughed and
said it was no
big deal. So I
broke up with him.
:Now friends are telling
me I'm being an
asshole. Was I out
of line for ending
our relationship just because
he ate a hot
dog every day?
