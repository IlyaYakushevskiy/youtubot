Am I the Asshole for BLMing my friend's wedding?  So my best friend is getting married in a few weeks, and I'm not sure if I was an asshole for what I did. We were finalizing the seating arrangements for the wedding, when I heard that she was giving an extra seat to one of my friends from university. I asked her why, and she said that it was because he was her "best" friend from university. :I was taken aback and told her that I felt slighted, because I was her "best friend" and we have a much longer history and stronger connection. She said I was just being selfish and making things up, and that she had already invited him. :I wasn't budging, so she decided to just buy an extra seat for my friend and still give the other seat to her "best" friend from university. I consulted with a few of our mutual friends and we decided to contact the venue and just cancel the extra seat she had bought. :She's really mad at me, but I was just trying to stand up for myself. Am I the Asshole for doing this?
