Today, my next door pregnant neighbor knocked on my door.
**
Around 7 pm today, I heard some knocking on my door. I opened it and it was my next door pregnant neighbor (she was, I think, in her 7th or 8th month). She was holding a small plate in her hand. In a very shy voice, she asked me if I can give her some of what ever I was cooking because she liked the smell. I think pregnant women sometimes have strong cravings and they can not resist it.

 Anyway, She was shy and apologized a lot for her request since we don’t know each other. I laughed and told her it is ok :). I was cooking a traditional meal from my country and the recipe has olive oil, garlic, jalapeños and some spices. I think the smell was nice. I gave her some of my dinner then she left.

I Watched her walking home like a cute little penguin who’s happy with her successful little hunting 🙂 I felt really happy too for some reason.

My daughter was granted a Make A Wish and I'm sad
**
My daughter has a rare blood disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopedia pupura (immune) which causes her immune system to destroy her platelets so she just bleeds, randomly. Her eye just hemmoraged a few weeks ago and an entire half was filled with blood, today, five hour nose bleed. She can feel when they're coming and she sits down with her bloody nose kit, tissues, a trash bag, a puke bucket for when she swallows too much blood and vomits, gauze, cold packs. My daughter is four. 
I have been able to convince myself for almost three years that ya, she is sick, but not THAT sick. Last week we spent four days at the hospital for severe anemia and no detectable platelets. She is THAT sick. I get it now. She is getting a wish, and she is getting worse because she is that sick. 
We have tried every medication available for treatment of this disease. Nothing helps. Nothing fixes it. My heart is broken.

I have no respect for people who are pro-life
**
(CORRECTION: I MEANT ANTI-CHOICE/PRO FORCED BIRTH)

Edit: I personally am not someone who would get an abortion. Someday I would love to have babies of my own. BUT for other women, I will not judge them for what THEY do with THEIR bodies. I will NOT tell them what THEY should do with THEIR lives. What they decide is their choice & all these people who think they are God and whatever can't seem to get their heads out of their ass to realize what the new law just did for women out there. 

For people who are pro-birth/anti-abortion:
As a women. why are you doing this to other women? As a man, why tf are you even speaking on this?
//
I photoshop every photo of my mom
**
My mom has really had a hard time the past few years. When she entered menopause she gained weight and no matter how much she works out or what diet she tries she cannot drop it. 

She is a wonderful person, beautiful inside and out, but I could tell it was really taking a toll on her. So I started (lightly) photoshopping pictures I take of her before I send them to anyone or print them. I just nip a little here and there, slight reshaping. and smoothing out a few wrinkles, nothing drastic, but enough. 

Since I have started this she has started acting more confidently and has stopped making negative remarks about pictures she is in. She loves being in pictures with everyone again.

It has really helped. I have not told anyone and never will. 
//
I'm dying but haven't told anyone
**
I was diagnosed with cancer a little over two weeks ago, after a regular checkup.  Turns out I have a tumour on my colon that has spread to other areas (liver and lungs so far) and will require extensive chemo and surgery for any chance to live longer than 8 months

I'm not having any treatment and I haven't told my wife because she'll only pressure me to get the treatment, which result in months of pain and suffering for a relatively small chance

Instead, I'm making sure our last few months together are filled with only happy memories.  I'm starting work later and finishing earlier each day, to make her breakfast in bed and take her on dates in the evenings

My landlord I rent my workshop from has agreed to let me run my business rent free for the next 6 months, which means significantly less financial stress and I can save a lot more, so she has something to carry her over afterwards

I hope she'll forgive me for taking this path

finally found out why my gf kept giving me squishies
**
edit: squishies are a type of soft squishy toy thing? its hard to describe but you just. squish it. it's almost like a plush

so. my girlfriend and i have been together 10 months now, but we've known eachother since 1st grade.

anyways, my girlfriend kept giving me squishies, on my birthday, out of the blue, and recently on Christmas, despite me never expressing any want or need for them. honestly i didn't know much about them before she started giving them to me.

Yesterday she told me that when she was recovering from self harm, squishies were one of the only things that helped her, and that she was giving them to me because she wanted to see me recover. I'm two months clean, and i almost cried when she told me. i'm so lucky to be dating her, i love her so much.

I poked a hole in a condom and purposefully got a girl pregnant to prove I wasn't gay
**
 This was the late 80s  and I was 14/15  and things weren't a great time to be a gay teenager not that it excuses what I  did. I  was so afraid of being outed  that  I started a relationship with my then bestfriend's sister.    My friends were constantly messing with me about  not having slept with her and calling me gay. They were just joking but I took it so seriously that I convinced her sex and I poked a hole in the condom hoping to get her pregnant so that I'd have proof...


She did end up pregnant and when I found out the reality of what I did really hit me.. She just thought the condom didn't work and I never told her I did it on purpose... She was forced to go to an alternative school and eventually dropped out to have the baby. Her and her family moved away with the  baby and I never kept in contact with them... I've always felt like a pos for ruining her life and abandoning my kid.
//
my girlfriend is disabled/in a wheelchair. She doesn't actually need my help in the bathroom, we're just going together so she can suck my dick
**
That's basically it. When in public places she likes to give stealth blowjobs but when it's too busy for that we go to the accessibility washrooms together and do it there. Everyone assumes I am helping her do her business. She doesn't actually need help, she just wanted a hearty load.

Edit: for the people waiting of receipts, some of you who watch the news might know southern Ontario got wrecked by a storm yesterday. We are still without power here, only our emergency generator which powers the missus' medical stuff. I charged our phones at a Walmart while picking up a couple of coolers and ice bags to save our freezer and fridge stuff. I'll hit you guys up after we get power back. 

And for the record the power outage fried the God damn water heater so I had an ice shower today. If my balls shrink any further they'll turn into a black hole.
//
I pavlov'd my girlfriend
**
My ex used to use a specific shampoo and over time i noticed that every time i smell this shampoo on other people i automatically think of her and this got me planning..

For my current girlfriend, every time we got down to business i put on a cologne that i saved specifically for those times. No matter how spontaneous the action was, i found the time to put on a puff or two of this perfume secretly and then continue.

After weve been going on for couple months, i began to do tests - i put this perfume on when casually walking in the kitchen past her, and just sat down in the living room. Soon enough, after couple minutes she got here and initiated sexy times!

Now i use it ocassionally (im very careful not to overuse it so it doesnt spoil the effect) when i want to get hee going, and it works well enough :)

My favorite is putting it on before going out to a public place, and watching her get super worked up and unload at home
//
I upvote anyone that comments on my posts, because it's often the only time I'll experience anything remotely like kindness..
**
My life sucks. But thank you to anyone that does bother replying to any of my posts! 

EDIT: Just woken up to the most amazing comments, honestly led here in the dark reading them all made me cry, thank you, thank you to whoever gave me gold. I hope you all have a great new year.... I'm making sure i havnt missed anyone! 

Edit 2: I am completely blown away by the response to this  I'm glad to see lots of people getting upvoted to! And thanks to Every One that gave me gold, I didn't deserve that!  But so much did I just need to hear some kind words. You have all cheered me up on a really crappy day!

I am having such a hard time keeping my adoption secret
**
I've been a foster dad to my son since he was 5. He is now 9. He's been through a lot and has made significant progress. I am so proud of him. I've been trying to officially adopt him and have spent over $30,000 over the last two years to make it happen. He has no idea. The social worker came by to visit and I told him it was to see how he was doing, but he was worried that I might be getting rid of him so he's been very anxious and clingy, but I've been a bit emotional too. I am getting the paperwork all signed and sealed by my lawyer this Thursday (when the dumbass judge comes back to work). I want to surprise him by showing him that he is officially my son, although he always was and will. I thought about surprising him with the news at his favorite restaurant this Saturday with his Aunt and Uncle and cousins. Keeping this secret is harder that the actual adoption. 
//
I've secretly started vaping weed
**
I started vaping weed. My husband doesn't know. I have really bad anxiety and depression, and we have two toddlers  My prescription medication makes me feel nauseous and I hate it. Weed isn't legal here, but I live right on the border of a legal state. It makes me feel so much better. I've gone a week without yelling at my kids or husband. I've been cooking and cleaning more. I want to actually cuddle and be intimate with my husband now. I can sit and listen and play with my kids without getting irritated or just dreading the fact that they're making a mess. I'm not anxious and sad and stuffing my face. My low-carb food tastes delicious now, so I'm actually losing weight. I haven't been getting my daily tension headaches. I'm happy to get out of bed in the morning, and I quit my prescription sleeping pills. I always thought weed made you a depressed couch potato, but it's having the opposite effect on me. My husband is uber conservative and already is kind of disgusted that I take stuff for anxiety/depression. He definitely wouldn't like this.
//
I always call my regular customers order before its ready because she's old and it takes a while for her to walk and I want the food hot for her.
**
I have a regular at the place I work. She comes in almost every day. She's very old but just so warm and sweet. She always orders the same hot pressed sandwich. I buzz her order that its ready when it really still has about a minute left because I know it takes her at least a minute to get to the counter, and I don't want the food sitting there and getting cold. Its the little things that people may not even notice or realize, but I'm sure they appreciate it. 

Edit: I can not believe this has received over 250K views and over 5000 upvotes. Y'all are awesome and I appreciate the love and encouraging words :)

I unfollow women on social media when they announce they’re pregnant.
**
They’re so annoying, only posting stuff about their baby like it’s the only thing going on in their life. It gets worse after the baby is born because they end up posting like 50 pictures of their kid doing shit kids normally do. Usually it’s a friend’s girlfriend or wife. I know it’s a nit picky thing to do, but I hate babies anyway. 

Edit: Maybe I should have been more specific. The women who are my friend’s girlfriend or wife. These aren’t my close friends, they’re more like acquaintances, so it’s not like I’m abandoning my best friend or some shit. Jeez.

To the incels who think I also unfollow women once they get in a relationship or when they get married:

NO I don’t unfollow them when they get a boyfriend or get married. Astonishingly, I don’t only befriend women in hopes that we have sex. I just don’t like kids and I think babies are ugly and annoying.

I’m sorry Colin Kaepernick. I hated you and your protest because I didn’t understand. Im embarrassed by my actions and I wish I could take it back.
**
 I was 13 when you first took a knee. In my eyes, America was the best country in the world and I loved it for all the good it has done. At the time I would have died for my country. And there you were, in direct opposition to the ideals I cared so deeply for. I hated you. I hated your protest. I stopped watching the NFL. I haven’t bought or worn nikes since. Everything about you was wrong. How could you hate something that was so perfect? How could you hate the land of the free and home of the brave? How could you disrespect the millions of American soldiers that have died for the flag? How could you hate my home?  

Only know do I see the America you’ve always seen. I am disappointed. I am disappointed in my country and I am disappointed in myself. You lost your dream job and had your name dragged through the mud by people like me because I was too blind to see the problems within my own home.  

I wish I could take it all back. I hope one day you can forgive me for all the wrong I’ve done to you. I’m sorry Colin Kaepernick.

Tonight I am going to bed at 8 o clock my time by choice.
**
To put it simply I am fat. I'm not big boned, not husky, chunky, or have a thyroid condition. I am simply fat due to eating too much and moving too little. I do not like being fat. So tonight I'm going to bed at 8 so that I can get up at 4 in the morning and run my fat little ass down the road and back and still have time to get ready for work. I've already went running two times this week. I was supposed to go this morning but I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in time. I'm disappointed in myself at this and with any luck I will do what I need to do tomorrow. Edit: right now my short term goal is to get to my proper weight but long term goal is to have a stomach that women could do their laundry on. 2nd Edit: For any who care I did go running that morning.

My stepdad came home drunk tonight
**
He came home from a work lunch that merged into dinner, and he’d been drinking for over 7 hours. 

He came home absolutely tanked and came into my room... and he almost cried because he said that he loved me so much. He made me stop studying, get up from me desk and gave me the biggest hug and couldn’t stop telling me how much he loved me and how lucky he was. 

It was so sweet. And when I finally convinced him to go upstairs to bed, I could hear him telling my mum how beautiful she was and how much he loved her too (and my mum laughing a lot while trying to get him ready for bed). 

I have the best stepdad ever. I’m so blessed.

EDIT: 1. formatting.
2. background - my real dad was an alcoholic.
3. Sorry it’s not a ‘real’ confession I just love him heaps and couldn’t post in r/wholesome cause it’s not a picture

I can't stand my wife
**
I've come to the realization that I just flat out do not like my wife anymore. It isn't a rough patch or something that I will work through. She is simply a person that I do not enjoy being around. She is a complete Karen who will literally demand a manager for every perceived sleight and it is fucking embarrassing as hell. She is constantly bragging and laughing about all the people she has argued with and blocked on various platforms like Facebook and Nextdoor. She never shuts the fuck up but never has anything or importance or relevance to say. Everything that she does is just nails on a chalkboard to me. But I couldn't imagine only spending half the amount of time with my kids, there is absolutely no way I could live with that. So I will just keep going pretending that I love her and am some devoted husband so I can try and set a good example for my kids and spend as much time with them as possible.
//
Why is everyone so enamored with the woman who enjoyed sex with the fat guy? I've been fucking fat women for years! Where's my Reddit Gold?
**
Seriously though. I've been out there doing what must be done and making sure the fat women/BBW's in my community are sexually satisfied for almost a decade! Where's my awards? My praise? My encouraging words? 

I'm the one out here risking my life having 400lb chonkers sit on my face until they cum. I could die and almost have a number of times due to lack of oxygen or having my ribs crushed from them riding me. I'm not complaining too much because it's hot but BE HONEST y'all would look at me, a skinny ass dude funny if you saw me with one of my big framed ladies or call me a fucking pervert or tell me I'm objectifying or fetishizing them or some other bullshit. 

Yet one skinny bitch fucks a fat dude and you're all "YAS SLAY KWEEN!"

Fuck you guys.

Edit: Thanks for the awards, love and support and the DM's from big women. I'll gladly chat with any of you big gals 18+ and 250lbs and up only please. Thank you.

A stranger gave me a reason not to kill myself today
**
As the title says, a stranger on reddit gave me a reason not to kill myself today. So I posted on a subreddit and I said that I wish that my parents fidnt hit me anymore, I have mental problems and I always have but I was at my breaking point today. 2 people responded normally while another person asked if I'm alright. Anyways, I said that I could be better and they gave me 2 phone numbers to call and just talk about it. I said thank you and then they said, just know that a stranger on the internet cares about you. I'm very emotional so I started crying like a little baby. I was going to end my life today but I've decided not to. So thank you u/OatsnMoats. You just saved a life.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your support! I've never cried this much before so just thank you all. I will take my time and try to get better. If any of you guys are wondering, I'm turning 14 on December 29. Thank you all again!

I insulted a child who I thought was wearing a costume
**
While waiting outside my kids’ school to pick them up, a class of middle schoolers walked past. It was close to Halloween. I looked up when a girl with makeup and colored hair called out, “Hi!” to me. 

I was kind of caught off guard but noticed she was made up for Halloween and guessed she wanted some attention for her costume. I noticed what looked like big teeth and assumed the were fake. Trying to be funny, I said “Wow, you really need to see a dentist.”

Almost immediately, I regretted it. I think I heard her mutter, “how rude.” And, my brain finally caught up and realized her teeth were not fake but just abnormally prominent. 

There was nothing I could do at that point. I’ve seen her once more around the school but didn’t say anything. I can’t really say, “sorry, I thought those were fake costume teeth.” That wouldn’t help. Now, I just feel like an asshole. I physically cringe every time I think about it.

I'm not loosing weight to get healthier, I'm doing it cause I wanna try all sorts of weird sex stuff.
**
I want to do a lot of specific sex stuff and my body being how it is now.... I just feel people will be more likely to engage in the the things I want when I have a more conventionally attractive body. I'll probably enjoy it more too.

I will continue to tell my friends, family and doctor that I'm just trying to be healthier.

Edit: Thank you SO MUCH for all the upvotes, I really didn't expect so much attention!! I really appreciate it and I'll do my best for everyone!

Edit 2: Oh my god thank you so much for the awards!! This is my first time getting one! I hope everyone continues to have fun and for people asking about getting started and feeling confident etc, my DM's are always open

Since my wife's back problems started I've been sleeping like a baby.
**
15 years of marriage, traditionally my wife is someone who doesn't like to be touched while they sleep. Usually She wakes up like it's a 5 alarm fire if even my feet touch her sometimes.

Her lower back problems have started up again and she's been sleeping with my arm as a pillow but for a couple weeks now it's progressed into her sleeping with her head on my chest and leg and arms across me, essentially using me as a body pillow/teddy bear. We don't know why this relieves the pain, but it helps her to fall asleep. She used to wake me up and ask for my arm, but two times this week I've woken up to the full on body pillow style snugs.

&#x200B;

When I was a lonely teenager I used to put my free weights inside my pillow and (nothing sexual...promise) lay them on top of me so I would know what it would feel like to have someone lay on you that way. This is literally my dream come true.

I had to explain to my 68 year old mom what safe porn is.
**
She is divorced after being married for 40 plus years. She is just exploring stuff that maybe she never explored before, it's understandable and I wouldn't judge her for that. But she was breaking her laptop a lot. I couldn't figure out why. I kept going over to her house, running virus scans and malware scans, installed good protection, ect. (I'm by no means a computer doc). 

Finally, I asked her if she had been clicking on weird links or following popups. Nope. So with a red face, I asked her about porn (she is very conservative and proper acting). She turned red too and said "I search for free porn on the internet." Oh, mom. Lmao

So I told her about pornhub and explained why she can't just wander around the internet clicking on every free porn site that's offered.

Weirdest and one of the most awkward conversations I've ever had with her but maybe she won't destroy her computer every other month now.

Male nurse laughed at my small penis in the hospital
**
About 7 years ago, I was hospitalized for a week with a bad stomach infection. There was one event which has stuck in my mind. One night, I needed help with changing my hospital gown so I called the male nurse. He came to my room and I had to get nude in front of him to change gowns. 

There was 30 seconds where my nude penis was exposed to his view. I saw his eyes look down at it and he had that reaction where someone is trying to hold their breath to not laugh but the laugh can be heard anyway. I immediately knew he was laughing at my small penis. But even more humiliating was that I said nothing, I stayed submissively quiet like a child and let him get away with it. 

I have one of those penises where its like a little boy when soft. I have noticed that a lot of people judge cock size by how big you are when you are soft. When I'm hard I'm close to average size so laughing at my cock solely based on how small it is when soft seems unfair.
//
I paid for a stranger's abortion
**
I'm part of the subreddit abortion and I saw a post from a young woman who was panicking because she's pregnant and can't afford an abortion. I told her to private message me and I provided her with resources like aidaccess.org 

I had her do a consultation with Aid Access, offered Aid Access $60 for the abortion pills which they agreed to, and had the package sent to my house. I took the package from Aid Access and put it in a bigger box. I then filled this box with heat packs, ibuprofen, basic sanitary stuff, and some chocolate. I then sent the package to her work so her abusive boyfriend doesn't know about this. 

A week and a half later, she emailed me to say she went through with the abortion and she was doing well. I don't regret this one bit. Her boyfriend can't trap her in a relationship and I hope she finds a way to leave. Sisterhood.

It's such a hot topic, hence why I confessed to it. Also my extremely conservative parents will be blissfully unaware of this. Technically it's a confession if I'm keeping it from some people.

I'm a foreign student in Ukraine, and I am so scared
**
Two weeks ago, my university forbid us from going back home under threats of expulsion, and now we're stuck here. They don't communicate with us, and any updates I get are from fellow students who created WhatsApp groups. Yesterday, they sent a list of bomb shelters to the group page, and it kind of hit me that this is actually real, and I could die. I really regret coming here. Now all borders and airspace are closed and prices have rocketed. We're on a curfew, and atms have stopped working. My country's students union found a bus for us to go to Lviv and then to Poland but they're saying only 35 seats are available and I don't think I'll be able to get one. I don't want to die!!

I made a facebook meme page in high school that got the police involved
**
When I was in high school I created a meme page that made fun of every teacher, student and faculty there (some of them were extremely offensive and were basically attacks on individuals). I just kept doing them for the lolz. Once the administration got a hold of it they hired a private investigator to find the culprit.   
  

Luckily I wasn't that stupid so I made and uploaded all my memes from the library computer. I started making memes making fun out of the shitty administration and the investigation which then escalated into a whole chase for me with the police involved. They threatened legal action but since they couldn't find me I just kept memeing my way through high school. During my graduation day, I posted one final meme that said that I just graduated and that the search teams sucked ass. I think at that point they had an idea it was me but they never proved it.
  
  
It feels good to finally let it out haha. I never told anyone out of fear for snitches

I lied to my mum about my nan's last moments
**
My nan passed away two years ago. I was there when she passed away, it was just us, late at night.  I told my mum, our whole family, that she had drifted to sleep when the heart monitor flatlined.

She hadn't. She was in pain, confused, wanting her mother. Her last words were asking for her mother. All I could do was hold her hand and tell her I was here.

I can't bear to tell them how afraid she was. They don't need that pain. But I had to tell someone. So here I am.

Edit: This blew up. And you guys are amazing. Thank you. I'm crying in a good way 💜💜

A little more information: She had cancer and was really weak towards the end. We knew it was coming but she went downhill quickly.

I'm going to continue as is. I think my older cousin likely knows that wasn't the full story, but she's never asked. It's better this way for all of us. We're a small but tight knit family unit.

To people all around the world, 

We, Hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our Hong Kong Police Force. At about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in Prince Edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. Meanwhile, the police haven’t arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd. 

We, Hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope that people all over the world can help us in anyways you can think of. Thank you and we will stay strong.

My little brother has tried to kill my little sister twice and I look forward to any excuse to never have to talk to him again. I hate him. He's 7 years old.
**
Every single thing about him is repulsive to me. I'm 26, so we have a bit of an age difference. I've spent a lot of time around children and I've never met one to whine and complain and scream about anything and everything as much as he does. 
He's tried to kill my little sister (3yo) twice now. Once he held her head under the water in the kiddy pool until someone caught him. The second time he held a pillow on her face until my mom caught him because she heard a ruckus in the living room. My mom tried the "he's seven he doesn't know better" defense, but I would argue that because he's taken and finished swimming lessons he knows what it means to drown. 
He has manipulative tendencies that take too much text to get in to, but he's said things to me that hurt me in a way that I can't forgive whether he meant them or not. 
If we find dead animals under his bed or he gets caught with a dead body one day, I'm fully prepared to tell my entire family "I told you so," and let them be mad at me because this kid is nuts and I want nothing to do with him.

I called Child Services on an anti-vaxx parents because they kept asking for “natural” remedies online for their severely sick child instead of taking their child to the hospital because they don’t believe in doctors or medicine
**
I don’t feel bad at all because not vaccinating your child is something but not getting medical care for your severely sick child because you don’t believe in doctors or modern medicine is to me a form of abuse. 

Edited: The reason this is a confession is because the people I reported were once very close family friends so i may not regret it but I still feel bad because that’s just me and no one in my family knows it’s me 

Update: I called child services to ask for an update and they told me the case is closed and nothing else. I heard my family talking that his/her parents took him/her out from the hospital and that’s it. Basically, all I did is nothing and I didn’t help my god child at all. 

Edited: Thank you everyone for all your kindness and encouragement. 

Edited: For all the people that wrote negative comments on this post hope all of you have a good day and never judge a book by its cover.

My wife thinks I’m just being cute and romantic

I have always called my wife by terms of endearment rather than her name; Sweetheart, Darling One, etc.  After 23 years of marriage she is actually taken aback if I call her by name at this point, which almost never happens anyway.

There’s a reason, and it’s not because it was an ex-girlfriend’s name or anything like that.  It’s just... I hate it.  I think it’s an ugly name.  It grates on me, rubs me entirely the wrong way, and I can’t stand using it to identify someone I’m very much in love with.

(I won’t say what it actually is because she might read this and I’d rather she didn’t find out, so let’s just say it’s Gretchen, which is a name I hate in the same way.)

Not as juicy a confession as some on here, but that’s mine.

&#x200B;

*Edit:  I’m really surprised at how many people assume she must be “Karen.”  I did say we’d been married for 23 years.  Karen was just another name only a few years ago.*  


*Edit 2:  Okay, what the hell.  It’s Rachel.  Sorry if that was anticlimactic.*

God saw me puke cum
**
So I visited this guy in a halfway house late one night.  
I gave him a sloppy, mind-blowing blowjob and swallowed the most putrid cum I've ever tasted in my life. I mean, it tasted like straight gasoline and chemicals. I swallowed it on an empty stomach, and it left a filmy layer on my tongue.  


So, I'm driving home and my stomach starts churning, my mouth gets watery, It's really threatening to come up. I knew this road and the only place to pull in for miles was Grace Covenant Church.  


There I am, face sweating, body shaking, yacking up globs of the most vial seminal fluid I've ever encountered.  


Wiped my mouth, hopped back in my car, and drove home. I said a little apology prayer to God.

I, a 27yo male tripped over a teenager yesterday and i got real satisfaction from it.
**
so i was walking home from work as i do daily, and i work right near a school so pass the children as they're leaving school (i finish at 3:30 some days). I was walking and seen this group of clearly horrible teenage girls. one of the girls ran up to this girl who was on her own walking in front of me and pushed her and this made me angry (especially during school i was bullied all the way through). i then seen the girl run passed me again to do it again so on her way back to her friends laughing and thinking she was high and mighty i decided to stick my foot out. she went flying smashed her chin on the floor and it looked like she started crying. i carried on walking feeling great about it and i'm not ashamed either. fuck trashy bullies. 


edit: apologies for the misleading title, some of y’all have some fucked up minds 😂 i am british and i think this might have something to do with the wording!

Last week I discovered that I am infertile likely due to 10+ years of cock and ball torture.
**
I was always really into BDSM and femdom. Especially cock and ball torture and started getting into that in my early 20's (I'm 36 now) I've spent years of my life having professional dominatrixs dom me and beat/stomp on my testicles. I don't know why I find it hot or enjoy but I do. Regardless, I wanted to donate sperm for some extra cash but they did a test on me and it turns out I have incredibly low sperm production and motility to the point where the odds of impregnating a woman incredibly low and almost not existent. 

I saw a doctor specializing in fertility and the doctor examining me was shocked by the amount of scar tissue and trauma my testicles have gotten over the years. He had some recommendations to help but I really was never interested in having kids so I'm not too bummed out. I'm more bummed about not making money donating sperm to be honest. Regardless I'm almost completely sterile from too much cock and ball torture that I still enjoy from time to time.

I let my son ditch school for a video game event
**
My son is 9 and he’s really into fortnite. I guess there is some event going on today and he’s been so excited about it. However, this morning we figured out that the event would be happening during his “zoom” hours at school. I’m the type of parent who is super involved with their kids school stuff. Very strict about grades. 

Decided to let him take the day and enjoy his event. Emailed the school and said he had a headache.

Feeling like a rebel 😂

* Edit *

I didn’t think this would blow up so fast but I wanted to add some info so people quit making assumptions.

1- This event was virtual. My son did not go to a physical event. I would not let him go to something like that during a pandemic. 

2- We live on the west coast. This event was during school hours for people on the west coast.

3- I am a mom. Moms can be cool too. 

4- If you don’t agree with it that’s cool. I’m not telling you to let your kids skip school for video games. This was a confession. Chill out.

My cat makes me cry every night
**
So, I got a cat like 3 months ago. She is the purest, fluffiest baby in the world, but the most important part of this:
Every night since I got her, around 9pm, she will jump into my lap (no matter where I am sitting), climb up to my face and give me nose kisses and then proceed to curl up and purr herself to sleep. And then I just sit there, and look at this little loaf of fluff, and I cry. Every time. I just can't handle how cute she is and how much I love her I guess.

Sorry for rambling, just felt like sharing.

Edit: Guys you are so sweet :) unfortunately I don't know how to link pictures, but you can find them on my Profile!

I just pooped my pants while driving my car.
**
I am a grown woman (pregnant) and my son was asleep in the car. We were stuck in traffic, almost home and I couldn’t stop anywhere because said child was asleep. I shoved some wipes in there and it just exploded. This is the worst day and I’m so embarrassed and can’t tell anyone so I decided to tell you guys. Please tell me this has happened to others.

Edit - HOLY CRAP YOU GUYS!! I had no idea this was going to be so dang popular 😂😂 thank you all for making me feel better about my poop accident! I’m not scarred for life and I’m able to laugh about it now. My husband is super proud of me being at the top of the subreddit with my poop story.

My 10yo son made me cry tonight
**
Not really tucking him in, but more of a few minutes of quiet father-son time.

After he was done with his shower, he told me he didn't want me to say goodnight in his room anymore.

I asked him why and he said "dad I'm a 10yo kid."

My first response was going to be "so?" But instead I said "okay."

I was fine with his not wanting to hold hands or walk besides me or meeting him outside his class, but this actually broke my heart. I love this kid so much. I won't lie. I went to bed and cried like bitch.

Update: Thanks for your comments. I have been busy and am shocked this got so many upvotes. I have a couple of theories why he doesn't want me to tuck him in at night. At least he'll still go in my bed to watch Youtube videos or play video games and still thinks my dad jokes are funny.

War is Darkness
**
I'm from Iran. I used to come to reddit to feel better and have a laugh or two. After the recent events everything has changed and everybody is making memes about WWIII, and it makes me sad to see all of these memes and funny photos of war in Iran. I know it's fun but on the other hand people seem to forget that with war comes darkness. So many people are gonna die and sadness will consume my country and the US (it's already happening imo). I'm not taking my government side or the US. All I'm saying is that war is not the answer. I wish it didn't happen. Iranian are friendly people. the government does not represent it's own people. I strongly hope the war doesn't happen and the phase of WWIII memes goes away and we go back to baby yoda memes.  


Edit: Thanks for all the warm and kind word from all over the planet. I honestly am afraid of dying, but your words and supports means a lot to me. thanks.

I had the most intimate moment ever with a stranger on a public bathroom
**
 

**I was taking a shit at work (yeah, I shit at work, and I wold shit on the streets if I needed it) and an unknown man walks in, kinda beatboxing the instrumental from Bon Jovi – Always. I didn’t recognize his voice and probably don’t know him, since my work building has 3 stores and I know like 20 people here. So he starts peeing and goes “This romeo is bleeding”… I wait 2 seconds to be sure he wouldn’t continue, and go like “But you can’t see his blood”**  

**He proceeds, still peeing: “it’s nothing but some feelings, this old dog kicked up”**

**I continue: “It’s been raining since you left me, now I’m drowing in the floor, You know I’ve always been a fighter, but without you I give up”**

**He, now washing his hands “I can’t sing a love song, like the way it’s mean to be, well I guess I’m not that good anymore, but baby that’s just me” and opens the door to leave**

**And then I sang the chorus, listening this kind stranger sing along on the distance, going back to his work place.**
//
I just ate my first meal in months without throwing it back up.
**
I just wanted to tell somebody about my accomplishment so this seemed like the best place, also my family just doesn't understand it and thinks that I can just recover from my issues.

As the title says, I have bulimia. I have had it for a few years now, and I am usually on and off of recovery, but I have been purging for around 7 months since I relapsed. I purge every meal I have, and I panic if I don't get all of it out, but I eat at home so I generally do. Today I had oatmeal and fruit for breakfast and was planning to purge it up (yeah sad i know), but I was mentally and physically exhausted and just **done**. I'll be honest, just had a panic attack over it but I hope this is a new beginning for me. I just broke down over the phone with my long time therapist, so i'm seeing her later this week (:

thanks for reading, needed to get that off of my chest.

Edit: Thank you guys for all of the support. I will try my hardest to not let myself (or anybody else) down from this point on :)

All because of my mom
**
this is small but i just need to say it. 

my mom passed away two months ago, and they fired me from my old job because i had to leave immediately to go to her funeral. 

her favorite place to eat with me was wendy’s, which is where i work at now; and the thing she always got was baked potato with extra cheese and extra bacon. 

whenever i have to make a baked potato with cheese and bacon for a costumer, i secretly put extra cheese and extra bacon just because my mom liked it that way. 


edit:: i didn’t actually expect this post to get this much attention. all of your comments made me smile, and even tho i don’t know any of you, you guys made me feel less lonely than i felt this entire time. i seriously thank all of you guys for being supportive ❤️❤️

also thank you so much for the gold/silver award!! i appreciate all of this so much. thank you guys.

Apart from the human suffering part of it, I'm loving all this coronavirus stuff so far because...
**
\- I have to work from home for at least a month (sub-confession: same pay, half the work)

\- No guilt about not "going out and doing things" or having food delivered to me

\- Stocks are on sale at deep discounts (I'm a long-term investor with a 20 year horizon right now)

\- Backing out of plans has never been easier

\- Get to watch people wring their hands about Coachella and other hip, cool, absolutely unnecessary events (I don't count this as human suffering).

\- Shorter lines and wait times everywhere, and lots of discounts.

\- Trump and his entire administration are on the hot seat.

\- Anti-vaxxers are going to have to do some real deep soul-searching.

\- Every responsible workplace and manager from this point forward will stress "STAY HOME IF YOU EVEN FEEL THE LEAST BIT ILL". Drag-yourself-into-work-anyway "heroism" will be discouraged.

\- The news and reddit has never been more interesting.

I have Covid 19 and it sucks.
**
I got infected working in health care, even when wearing a mask. I'm a 31 yo male in the American Midwest. I thought it wasn't a big deal but my God, this virus sucks the strength right out of you. I never got a fever so my supervisor didn't let me leave work several times but I had a cough. I'm afraid I infected my coworkers and residents. 

Lately, I've felt like I have mucus on my lungs and pressure on my chest but it comes and goes. The muscle pain is horrendous and feeling like you have no energy to move. I know we are all mortal but this shit does scare me. Please, everyone that reads this, take care to protect yourself. This sickness is real and could kill me or you, no matter your age.
//
I have an outie vagina and I’m getting real tired of girls as a whole getting picked on for it
**
There are all sorts of variations of vulva, but in short, I’ll just go with this. There are innies and outies (and lots in between, but I’ll simplify it). Innies are the smaller labia minora, tucked in, kind of looks like a peach from afar. The outies, on the other hand, have the larger inner labia, they aren’t closed, the lips are larger and can fold open, looking more like butterfly wings I suppose.

Innies? They get called “porn star” or “designer vaginas”

Outies? They get called “roast beef” “meat flaps” “floppy ham sandwich” whatever form of meat you can name, this type of vulva has been called that.

It may seem funny... but a LOT of women have outies (maybe the minority, but idk). And it’s not funny to them, who feel insecure, like they need to get labiaplasty and cut off these beautiful flappies to appease society’s standards of what labia should look like.

Well I'm going to spread my labia wings to fly and go play somewhere else. hmmmmf.

I'm 97 days sober from alcohol, I never thought I'd make it this far. I went from suicide attempts to new job and new perspectives.
**
My day 100 is this Saturday and I have so many good things planned. Therapy appointment in the morning. I get to visit with my niece and nephews for the weekend! Had a huge falling out with my sister due to our alcoholism so I haven't seen them in months. 
I organized a covid safe paint night with my closest friends! Just recently deactivated all social media platforms for 100days to help further my healing. Obviously, not reddit though. So much has changed in the past 3 months and I'm so proud of myself.

Edit: I guess I'm new here. My confession is i did horrible things to people I love so I got sober.

I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin
**
I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils).
The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m 99% sure they don’t know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.
//
I tighten peoples water bottles when they piss me off
**
I'm a personal trainer and this slippery slope of passive aggressive behavior started in college. I worked the university gym and my coworkers could be really pretentious. Id hear them talk shit about average Joe's just trying to get in shape or the typical shallow shit talking in general. Id wait patiently for them to walk away to do rounds or go to the bathroom. (Timing is everything with this scheme) When the time came Id make my move,  squeezing and tightening to a brief exhaustion. Sometimes I'd peel skin off my hand. After I graduated I continued this behavoir at other gyms. My favorite target are racist old ladies that are deadset on making a good day a bad one cause they cant use their favorite recumbent bike. I'm aware how pathetic I am for this, and how it reflects poorly of my character. But I can't help it, the adrenaline rush is savoury. Knowing I mildly inconvenienced someone and they haven't had the slightest clue. I think I need counseling.
//
I'm so desperate to have sex with a female clown I can't take it.
**
More than anything I just want a beautiful woman with a clown costume, make up and a big red nose to have sweaty passionate sex with. I want her to lay on my bed, take her big shoes off and let me suck and lick her toes while jerking myself off while she blows up condoms and makes them into balloon animals.

They I want her to take off her clown pants and clown underwear then start pulling several feet of colored scarves out of her pussy. Once the scarves are out I want to enter her then fuck her as she honks her big red nose in time to my thrusts. I want her to do the clown laugh and spray me with a squirt gun flower as I cum.

I don't know why I have this fantasy but I do and it's killing me. I want clown pussy so bad it hurts.

Edit: Thank you all for the awards upvotes and comments and especially those of you who have turned me on to different subreddits and sites etc. Revolving around my kink. You guys rock!

My wife died. That bitch
**
We were having serious issues and then she got sick with cancer. That came like a mack truck. She said a lot of the grief she gave me was because she knew she was sick and was ashamed of burdening me and leaving me as a widow dad of four kids under 13.

I took care of that woman like she was one of my boys. That experience took 10 years off my life. Her death was easy compared to the aftermath. 

I was going through her computer and saw that she had a separate email account which was odd. That was on purpose. This bitch was planning on blindsiding with a divorce and was going back and forth with different lawyers about making me a weekend dad, throwing me out of my house and even seeing if I'd pay her legal bills. This went on a week before she saw the doctor.

This slag used me to take care of her in her final days because no one else would. I won't tell my kids...yet.
//
Today I found out my expiration date.
**
Four years ago I was diagnosed with lung cancer. No treatment till I got enough money. When I got it, I started getting in and out of hospital, chemo, CT scans and whatnot. I got sick of all that. I can't take it anymore.

Today is my lucky day. The doc told me my cancer is terminal. At most 2 months left to live. 

I guess I don't have to spend any more money. I guess I won't be getting exhausted from treatments anymore. I guess I'll have to wait till I expire.

Funny thing is, I wasn't even a smoker.

Edit: Thank you everyone with your heartwarming comments and messages. I've read most of them. I'd like to let you know since I didn't reply to many. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I always leave fries in a bag for my partner
**
She told me once that she gets really excited when she finds extra fries in the bottom of the bag (mainly McDonald's), as she feels like it's a hidden bonus.

Since we've been together, I always chuck a couple of my own in the bag when she isn't looking for her to find.

The excitement she gets from finding the fries warm my heart.

Edit:

Standard thank you for the awards.

But also to all the people who sent me very hateful and vitriolic personal messages, maybe someone would want to give you bottom of the bag fries if you were nicer to others? Like, I've received some messages wishing me death for "ruining Reddit".

I was a bad babysitter
**
When I was 15/16 I would watch my moms boss's kids while they were out until 1 or 2 am getting drunk. I took care of the kids until they went to sleep but after they were out, I'd get a small cup of chocolate flavored vodka from their pantry, as many fruit by the foot and gushers as I could hold and watch porn on their desktop computer until I was really wet and then I'd masturbate in their bed thinking about the dad. He was a really good looking, fit Italian 45 year old lawyer. Looking back I've always wondered if they had any cameras but they kept having me back so probably not. The best part was they would always get back drunk and empty their wallet to pay me, usually around $100.

***Edit: It has been 11 years since this happened. I no longer masturbate in people's beds, I just masturbate in my own home these days.

Also, the response to this is really crazy. And this is one of my tamer stories! Haha

I'm dying and I'm scared.
**
I am 34 years old from the UK. During the pandemic lockdowns, I started getting headaches which my doctor said was stress. I eventually collapsed and ended up in hospital where they diagnosed me with Glioblastoma. It has spread to my spinal cord and bones and I've been given 4 months if I went ahead with chemotherapy but I've refused. I have been given 6 weeks to live. I'm in my local hospice and I see other patients with family and friends. I have no family and no real friends who have stuck around. I am on my own and I am so scared to pass with no-one by me. I feel selfish too. I am rambling. I'm sorry

I got a bunch of random dick pics from men in my general area sent to my lab partner’s phone.
**
It was freshman year biology in college and I had a lab partner who was a total dick. He was just a jerk to me, always talked about how much pussy he got, how hes gonna be a doctor and how much he hated “fags”. So towards the end of the semester he called me a bitch for not having a gf. I had his number on my phone and I got an idea. I made an ad on Craigslist under the “women seeking men” section using his phone number and a picture of some random girl I found online. 

The ad said, “Help! My boyfriend just broke up with me! He had a huge dick so I’m looking for someone to fill me up.” 

The next day in class, Dr. Chode came in all pissed off. I asked him what was up and he told me everything. That some asshole put his number on Craigslist and he got about 80 dick pics, a ton of texts, and someone kept calling his phone from a private number and just breathing. The best one was a text with a dick pic of a huge penis with the caption “Will this fill you up?”

My wife has little to no interest in sex with me. I'm going to suggest an open marriage tonight because I want sex and I've been unfulfilled with our sex life for over a year.
**
I'm just fed up at this point. I've tried to be understanding and kind with what she's going through but the fact is our sex life sucks. We barely have sex and when we do it's just her going through the motions like it's a chore. She clearly doesn't want sex with me anymore so fine. I should be allowed to pursue it elsewhere then. She can fuck anyone she wants too as well obviously because she certainly isn't interested in doing it with me.

We've talked the issue to death at this point and like I said I have tried to be understanding but honestly I just can't do this anymore. I don't even really want to fuck other women. I want my wife who enjoys having sex with me back. I want this to be a wakeup call and maybe make her jealous or better yet get a real answer as to what's actually bothering her.

An Essay My Sister Wrote Got Published in a Magazine With My Name as the Author.
**
A few years ago I was very Ill and in hospital but my school wouldn't give me any exemptions regarding schoolwork. I was hanging on a very loose thread and if I was to fail any classes that term the school said I would be held back a year.  

My sister knew that this would absolutely devestate me so because I could hardly lift my head and I was attached to countless drips at the time she took it upon herself to write and submit the assignment for me. 

About a month later my teacher excitedly showed me that she had submitted "my" piece to a magazine because of how well it was written and they had chosen to publish it - my name and picture was under the article.  

They mentioned it at my graduation, they gave me a medal for the subject and they even put an additional copy of the article in the schools magazine and my sister just played along the whole time and still does whenever someone brings it up.  

She is an absolute legend and I can never thank her enough for saving my ass.

I accidentally called my mother in law out on how her vagina smells.
**

My wife’s mother has been staying with us to help with kids during the coronavirus. Yesterday I was on the floor in the den playing with the kids and kept getting this waft of soured smell. My mother in-law was sitting about 3 feet behind me on the couch. I initially thought it was feet or something. I asked if anyone else smelled it and everyone said no. I kept smelling it and was finally like “ y’all don’t smell that?? It reaks”. My mother in law turned bright red and said she would go take a shower. 

It was so awkward. Today we’ve just acted like nothing happened. My wife and I talked about it last night and agree it was super awkward.

YALL THIS IS THE BEST

I AM SOOO HAPPY!!!

YALLLL!!! Okay so the covid-19 virus had me fucked up for like two weeks bc my job fired me immediately so I had to look for a job everywhere.

My 4th grade teacher taught me something I'll never forget.
**
I don't know why she felt the need to do it, but it's stuck with me through everything.

So my entire class had been making paper airplanes and terrorizing the teacher. She was fed up with it. She didn't want to see another paper airplane, but that didn't stop the class from making them. Now this was a small class (about 6-7 kiddos) and they all knew how to make paper airplanes. All of them, except me. Now, I was visibly distraught one day because they had all been making airplanes to fly outside at recess and I didn't know how to ask them to teach me.

My teacher must have noticed I was distraught and asked me to stay back during recess, which wasn't new - I was the trouble student, smarter than I should have been and never did my homework like I should have. 
But instead of keeping me back for unfinished homework she sat me down and taught me how to make a paper airplane....

This is my confession:
My teacher was amazing. Full stop.

I just ate an entire pint of ice cream while watching cartoons and it was the best damn feeling I’ve had in a long time.
**
For context, I’m a grown ass man with a job, family and home of my own. 

Today I was able to get off work early and happened to be near my parents place, so I popped by unannounced. 

Everything was pretty much in the same place as it was years ago when us kids moved out. 

My mom smiled, dropped her stuff (works from home), went to the kitchen and handed me the pint and a spoon. Dad stuffs my bag full of coffee and snacks for my home. 

While they go back to their thing, I turn the TV on and mindlessly watch cartoons while wolfing down my ice cream.   

Best feeling of relaxation I’ve had in a long time. Thank you for reading.

If All Lives Mattered we wouldn't need to say Black Lives Matter
**
To be clear, we never said "ONLY Black Lives Mattered".

In truth, we know that All Lives Matter. We've supported your lives thru history and now we need your help with Black Lives Matter because Black Lives are in danger.

Edit: I've been offline since I posted and have now only taken a quick glance on some relevant comments and the gist is this... Black Lives Matter is a social outcry against inJustice levied against the powerless, whether you're black, white, Asian, your ethnicity should not define your worth.

Black Lives Matter does not take away the rights of anyone, it's simply asking that everyone is treated with the same sense of respect and humanity and equal opportunity regardless of the colour of your skin.

To those who insist this is not a confession, it's what's on my mind and my heart so I write about it.

Due to Covid-19, I have spent more quality time with my wife in the last week than I have over the last 3 years combined.
**
Due to the crazy work work work culture of our world, and my wife and I being forced to work opposite shifts, we would see each other maybe 1 day a week for maybe 6 months of the year. And then not get to spend any time together at all for the remaining 6 months, basically kiss goodnight/good morning as we pass by each other. My wife doesn't have any paid time off which makes vacationing impossible. 

We just got married last year and hardly spent any time together. 

We are honestly the happiest we've been in a while due to the time we get to spend together now. I cook nice dinners for us everyday like I used to when we worked the same shift. We have more sex of course, and we laugh so much together. 

I'm on salary and considered essential so I was still working until this week, but I opted to stop working and go on EI for the first time in my life since my wife was already off work for a week. It sucks that it took a damn pandemic for us to be able to get some time together, but man oh man am I happy this virus came around.

Today I adopted a kitten to give me a reason not to kill myself
**
I’ve never had anyone I could count on.
My ex left me and it was devastating. He texted me on Sunday to tell me how I kind and loving I was, how he took me completely for granted. He told me not to change, that he needed to change. That he missed me. It gave me hope. I haven’t seen him in two months and I’ve missed him everyday. 

Today I found out he has a girlfriend and that I had misinterpreted everything. It broke me. I left work early and thought about driving my car off the road. 

Instead, I drove to shelter and picked up the sweetest black kitten, Beau. I’m going to give this guy all the love I have and the best life possible. It’s only been a few hours, but I love him to pieces. He’s snuggled up in my lap right now. I’m going to keep living for him. He is my reason for all of this. Thank you Beau. You and me forever, unconditionally.

My lifelong best friend shot himself in my bathroom.
**
It happened two days ago; I haven't told many people about this. He was visiting my apartment and was going through a rough time. His only parent, sister, and daughter were recently killed by a drunk driver a week before.

I'm not sure where he got the gun. I had no idea he had one. The image I saw in the bathroom has been in my head every minute of the day, and I haven't gotten much sleep. I feel entirely stunned. My parents still don't know, and they've known him since he was a child when I had a massive crush on him. I'm not sure how I will tell them.

I feel sick to my core; I don't think I will ever recover from this.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind messages. I will find someone to talk to. My cat has been my buddy these past 48 hours. [This dumb comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/migfec/my_lifelong_best_friend_shot_himself_in_my/gt4l16y/) made me chuckle a bit, first in a while since it was a bit absurd.

It's far past midnight for me, so I'll be trying to get some sleep so I can tell my parents in the morning. Good night everyone.

I finally got help for a dark secret I was holding on to.
**
For a long time now I’ve had to deal with intrusive sexual thoughts of underage girls. Ever since the thoughts started I thought they’d just go away but they started popping up more and more and it made me feel disgusted. I never told anyone for years, I just wished it would all go away but I realised that’s just not how it works. I started watching a lot of shows like To Catch a Predator and seeing all these people feeding into this disgusting urge and something just flipped in me. I didn’t want to become someone like that and let my own thoughts control me wishing it would go away but leaving it to late. Today, I finally started seeing a psychologist and told them what’s been going on and my thoughts. It felt amazing to finally tell someone and finally get some help. This is the first step to recovery and we are working towards finding the route of my issues and resolving them. I’m so thankful I spoke up about my issue before it was too late and out of control. I’m hopeful for the future.

My dental hygienist just turned me on.
**
I’m a woman, haven’t been sexually active for almost a year now. To my surprise, i was extremely turned on by my dental hygienist just now. 

The way he was talking to me throughout it, he’d softly ask if i was doing okay. He’d gently (almost sensually) wipe the sides of my mouth and lips, down close to my neck anytime water came out. He wouldn’t tell me to move my head, he’d confidently use just his finger and push my chin (with the top part of his finger not the tip) so my head would move a little bit. Also, when he’d stand above me with my mouth wide open while still asking if i’m doing okay.. turned me on 🤷🏽‍♀️ not to mention, his cologne. smelt amazing. 

I feel like a weirdo but hey that’s what the confessions are for right.
//
I'm a psychologist and it's annoying how people are always trying to diagnose strangers on this site
**
The way people throw around terms like "narcissist" and "sociopath" is particularly annoying to me, knowing how extensive the screening is for such disorders. There is no possible way for a person to accurately identify a mental disorder over the internet, no matter how much information is given to them. I see this a lot on relationship advice subreddits, people say things like "he's a toxic narcissist, dump his ass" when the only information they have is what's written in the post; one side of a story in less than 200 words. It's naive and it damages people's perspective on real mental illness.

It might just be a pet peeve of mine, or maybe it annoys other people too. Either way it's irritating as fuck
//
My bully is dead
**
7th and 8th grades were by far the two worst years of my life due to fact that I was relentlessly bullied by Joseph (made up name). The bullying got so bad at times, that there were several instances I contemplated ending it all. Yesterday while randomly googling, I found out Joseph ended up being a loser criminal. In the article I read about him, the cops said he had a rap sheet "30 feet long." Joseph is also dead.

While I generally don't wish ill will on anyone, I am here to confess that I am glad Joseph is dead. I got so much pleasure finding out that Joseph amounted to nothing but a loser criminal who was addicted to heroin and crack. In my opinion the world is better off without Joseph, and I am kicking myself that I let this loser affect me so much when I was younger - I wish there was a way to travel back in time and tell my younger self to stand up to Joseph, but alas that is not possible. If I knew where he was buried, I would love to go piss on his grave.

Feels good to get this out....thanks for listening.
//
Today I found out what the weird whispering noise is upstairs
**
My fiancé pretty much always has her headphones in. Loves music. She has music quite loud, so she will text me to say she’s got headphones in so that I don’t accidentally scare her by creeping behind her etc. If I’m going upstairs, I’ll call or text her to avoid giving her a heart attack. We’ve learnt from experience.
Sometimes though, I hear an odd whispering. It’s like someone is yelling but whispering yelling? Aggressive whispering I guess you could call it. 
I did the unthinkable and silently crept upstairs to see what she was doing, what the noise was. 
I found her arm in arm with the cat, holding her outstretched singing to her. Whispering singing, to our cat. 
I’ve never seen something so perfect in my life. I feel like I fell in love with her all over again. I love my little family.
//
I use the loud ass hand dryer while people are pooping so they can feel comfortable enough to, "let it rip."
**
I'm a nervous poo-er in public and ever time I go to bathroom at work and someone walks in, I hope to god they use the loud ass hand dryer to drown out the noises I make.
I imagine everyone else is like this so after I finish washing my hands and someone is still in there pooping, I turn on the dryer so they can quickly let it rip without being embarrassed about their sounds.

Edit: Anyone reading this, please help out all the dudes and dudettes in public bathrooms poop by any means necessary. Thanks.

Edit story: when I was a kid the family went  to target a and I really had to go, the bathroom was unusually filled with dudes taking giant shits, when it came to my turn, I sat down and as everyone else was exploding around me, I JUST COULD NOT POOP. I stood back up, walked out and told  my dad we had to go home. Sucks man.
//
I am a horrible father
**
I managed to find me and my son a place to stay after being in a homeless shelter for three months. He keeps thanking me every chance he gets and it breaks my heart. No kid should go through all that and I don't deserve a pat on the back for providing the bare minimum for him. The last two years took everything from us and the past couple of months have been really testing. I have been working every single day to save up for renting a place and I still cannot believe that we are moving in.

Spending Christmas at a shelter was so defeating but my  little man took it like a real champ. He never once asked for anything at all. I am beyond grateful that he was not taken away from me. His mom left us when he was 2 and he is the only thing that keeps me alive. I will move mountains to make sure that the rest of his childhood is the best.     
//
I broke a girls nose for kicking me in the balls when I was 15.
**
We were at school and we had a verbal fight.  
We both insulted each other, and she lost her shit and kicked me in the balls hard.  
I almost passed out from the pain, couldn't breath, felt like puking. Cried a little bit.  
Once I could stand again, I punched her straight in the face, breaking her nose.  


Honestly no regrets. A lot of girls did that shit at my school (over BULLSHIT, not in self defense), and if you ask me they all deserved a broken nose.   
The way they used that to terrorize boys, and almost get OFF on it should be considered sexual assault.   
It sure as hell made me feel exploited, attacked, humiliated and abused AS a boy by girls, and I felt like my genitals were violated too. It's not the same as "regular" physical violence.  
It felt GOOD to punch her in the face, made me feel less worthless. Like people can't just DO stuff to me.  
I don't understand how gender has anything to do with it. She's not a better person just because she's a girl, what she did isn't any better just because she's a girl, and she didn't deserve any better just because she's a girl.
//
I ate an entire birthday cake by myself, and I don’t regret it.
**
So, every time I went grocery shopping I passed by the bakery, and saw this amazing looking cake. I kept thinking to myself “when my birthday comes around I’m going to tell my girlfriend that that’s the cake that I want.” Then one day it hit me. I’m an adult and I can eat whatever the fuck I want. So, I went to the store.  On my way there I felt nervous almost like I was going to a drug deal. I kept looking around to make sure that no one I knew was there. Anyway, I bought it, drove home quickly, and ate it. It took me a full five days to finish the dirty fucker off completely; it was a huge cake. Absolutely worth it.
//
I let everyone believe that I’m antisocial and don’t like being touched when in reality I’m incredibly lonely and touch-starved
**
Not sure why I do it. I’m pretty shy, but I wouldn’t consider myself antisocial. I like having friends and I wish I had more, I’m just not good at putting myself out there because I psych myself out too much. 

The lie about hating when people touch me started when I was very young because I didn’t like hugging my parents. I still don’t, and prefer them not touching me ever. Anyone else however, friends, acquaintances, coworkers, I’m fine with. I love when they do the whole “I know you hate hugs but I’m hugging you” thing because I love hugs and it’s nice to be held for a bit. 

Again I don’t know why I always lie and say I don’t like being touched and that I don’t like talking to people when I know I do. Maybe I just like suffering who knows

Edit: Okay this got *way* more attention than I expected. There are a lot of comments to read but I’m trying to get through them all. It’s really nice knowing that I’m not alone in this and I’m really grateful for all of the support and kind words. Thank you 
//
I changed my sleep schedule to avoid my family
**
I have two raging tweenagers who never want to sleep. One night I passed out at 10pm and woke up at 5:30 am and got 4 whole fucking hours to myself in the morning to drink coffee and pursue my own freaking interests. This was a revelation.

&#x200B;

I realized that mornings could be my domain, so after 50 years of never being a morning person-- I forced myself to become a morning person, just to get some alone time away from my kids. I now regularly get 3-4 hours every morning without fighting or having to attend to someone elses needs.  And no one accuses me of being lazy or selfish, this is a win-win and I am ashamed it took me 50 years to figure out how great and productive I can be in the morning.
//
My 4 year old said "I hate you" and I cried
**
I didn't cry in front of her, i could have so she could have understood that she hurt my feelings. But I just said, "well, I love you". After she was in bed I broke down. 

&#x200B;

I'm a 100% single Mom, she isn't my first but she is my last, and I just wasn't prepared yet to hear her say those words yet. It hasn't been easy thus far, I don't have any personal relationships because I just wanted to make sure I give my kids 100% of Mom and I'm stuck turning to Reddit to whine to because I don't have a boyfriend to do that with. Lol. And even after giving them 100% they still hate me. Lol. 

&#x200B;

It's been a shitty night but hey, it's been 173 days since I've had a beer and my 4 year old saying she hates me isnt enough to make me fuck that up. Its enough to make me cry though, totally enough to make me cry.
//
I just hid in the bathroom to eat a cookie so I didn't have to share it with my wife.
**
It's my cookie.

They gave it to me at Starbucks this morning because they were late with my bagel, just to me. I saved it all day and now I wanted to eat the whole thing without being asked to share it, or feeling like I should because it's the polite thing to do.

I feel like I betrayed her, but I don't really feel bad. It was an awesome cookie.


*Edit - wow, I can't believe how this blew up. Many thanks to all you kind strangers for your awards and friendly words. I've tried to reply to all many of you as I can but there's just too many comments to keep up with if I don't want to get fired from my job. Rest assured that I'm doing my best to read every one of your comments.
//
I indirectly bribe my son into hanging out with me
**
He's 12 and definitely hit the age where he just wants to hangout with his friends and dad is just an afterthought. I could ask him if he would want to go to Magic Mountain and he would only if his friends could come too.

I have no real friends of my own. I don't have high social needs. But I enjoy spending time with my kid. The only time he'll spend with me is when he gets something. For example, I will make up some bullshit reason to go to Target because that entails two hours of talking and hanging out with him one-on-one. I learn more about him too especially when I buy him clothes. Something in the store will catch his eye and it leads to us talking, laughing and bonding. Of course he gets something but he's not playing me. He just sees it as something he likes to do with dad. Otherwise he'll say he's good when I ask him if he wants to hangout doing something different.
//
I can't stop hooking up with a girl with a breeding kink. It's hot but I'm scared.
**
So the first time we hooked up it became obvious she had a breeding kink. She told me she's on birth control and would prefer me not wearing a condom. She's super hot and someone I've known for awhile so I trust she's clean. Besides I was planning on pulling out but she got on top of me part way and it became really clear that she wanted me to finish inside her. She started kissing my neck and whispered in my ear "fill me" and I couldn't help it.

We've hooked up multiple times since then and each time I've finished inside her without a condom and I can't help it. She's ruining safe sex for me.
//
I know that I have an addictive personality
**
The other day my wife asked me what I would be doing if we weren't together. She said something about maybe she'd have a different career,  but I said I might be dead. She was really shocked and asked what I meant.  We met in college,  and prior to that I was experimenting heavily with a variety of illicit substances.  I eventually stopped everything but alcohol for her, but even now I sometimes have trouble controlling my drinking. I think that if I hadn't met her there's a chance I would have succumbed to substance abuse in some way, even if it might have been college experimentation at the time I met her. It's all very ironic, because now I'm a doctor who practices in an area at the epicenter of the opioid epidemic,  and when I deal with those patients I try to remember that I was really only one positive influence away from their position at one point. Sometimes I think all of us are only one positive or negative influence away from a different life. 
//
I haven't told my kids the reason my wife died.
**
My wife died five months ago giving birth to our son. It absolutely nearly broke me, I'm still hanging on by a thread most days. 

I generally don't lie or sugarcoat things to the older kids besides things like Santa and The Tooth Fairy. They're ten, six and two now. But when i looked at their faces when I was telling them that their mother wasn't here anymore, I couldn't tell them the truth. I didn't tell them that she died giving birth to their baby brother because I knew they'd resent him and I don't want that. I just told them that she had died. 

Maybe I would've told them if we could afford therapy but I can't, just another thing to fail these kids on. I'm writing this on my lunch break at work because I felt like the truth would suffocate me. In a few hours I'll pick the kids up from school and daycare, four kids who lost their mother - one who didn't even get to be hugged by her - and me, and we'll get takeout because I'm too tired to cook today, and they'll sit and watch Spongebob and laugh and I'll sit with the baby and think how oblivious they are. 

I feel guilty.

I Enjoy What the Current Situation is Doing to Celebrities
**
Allow me to explain: I enjoy seeing how the vacuous, narcissistic celebrities are going crazy, crying in their large houses, and complaining about how hard the quarantine is. This situation has made them and (hopefully) the general public realize just how of little importance celebrities really are. Yes they entertain us, but when you think about it, that makes them no more than glorified jesters, which is kind of sad. But in a way, a sadistic part of me can't help but enjoy watching them realize they their only marketable skill (pretending) isn't remotely important. Our society has glorified a nothing-position for too long, and it's nice to see that behavior temporarily suspended.
//
I'm 16 and pregnant
**
I can't believe this is happening. My boyfriend and I were so careful and used protection. And it was only our second time having sex. But after taking two different home pregnancy tests and getting the same result, I decided to skip school today and go to a doctor to confirm it. Turns out this is for real. I'm actually pregnant.

I plan on telling my parents tonight. We're going out for dinner, so I think that may be the best time. I figure there's less of a chance of them completely losing their shit if I do it in a public place. My parents weren't even aware that I'd been sexually active. Why did this have to be the way they find out?

I'm so scared and confused right now, but I know one thing for sure. I'm not having an abortion. I messed up big time by getting myself into this mess, but I'm not going to make another mistake. I want to have this baby. I know I'm not ready to be a mother, so I'll give him/her up for adoption. I just hope my parents will support my decision.

Please wish me luck for tonight.
//
I'm so upset that most guys don't know and won't ever experience the utter disgust and feeling of when you fart then it accidentally goes into your vagina if you're sitting the wrong way.
**
Funfact: this is a thing that happens, its gross and it makes my skin crawl like nothin' else.. 

This is a dumb thing to be upset about but man I'd take being a guy and accidentally sitting the wrong way subsequently sitting on my nuts, then having to worry about a fart getting in my cooche while sitting in a seminar.



Edit: Hon, you folks that upvoted just brought a near completely unwelcomed bit of info to some poor sods who actually were enjoying their day, browsing through reddit, just vibing. Then pussy fart knowledge slaps them upside the jaw. Kudos to you.

Edit 2: sex education has failed so many of you... I'm so sorry.. though on the bright side watch Sexplanations on YouTube if you want some better sex education, no matter what age you are. Turns out we're taught almost jack shit about our bodies and I think we need to change that.

My mom cooked and had me eat my pet ducks as a kid
**
I've always wanted a pet duck as a kid and my mom "caved in" and bought me three. She hoped that I would go tired of them, so she could teach me a lesson about how animal are worthless without a use, but I guess I was very stupid and I didn't get it.

I named them and used to play with them all the time. I would let them play in the kiddy pool and I imagined myself as the person who taught them how to swim. Yeah, I was so stupid. Because of how I first "taught" them how to swim (I kinda' threw them into the water). See, I'm such an idiot! One of the ducks, Bubbles, became scared of swimming (lol), so I had now a duck that I had to teach to overcome a phobia, the idiot me had induced.

But, this all ended when my mother just killed then to cook them for dinner as she had planned from the moment she bought them. At first she lied that it was chicken meat, but then caved in and just forced me to eat the duck soup and then their fried meat. There were three duck, so I had to continue eating them the next days.

I kept crying and got beaten every time I've cried.
//
I wrongly approved many patients medical prior authorizations when the computer said not to.
**
I worked for Anthem insurance about 10 years ago, in the prior authorization department for medications to be covered by their insurance. Each claim had multiple choice questions I had to ask the caller to determine whether or not the medication would be covered. One time in particular, the pharmacy called to have a man's Prograf covered. Which is an extremely important drug to have when you've had an organ transplant, without it your body may reject the organ. I went through the process and it was denied, but I claimed to make a mistake and went back and re-answered the questions in a more favorable way, the medication was approved. I did this a number of times before being fired.
//
This is a confession for my mum.
**
We grew up dirt poor. My mother struggled to feed us as she would like, but managed mostly. One Sunday my Dad went to the pub. He usually came back after a couple of pints, or when he was spent up. 

This one time he didn't come home for the Sunday dinner of fried chops. Mum just served it up to us kids and we all got plenty, we left nothing but fat in the pan.

Dad came in a lot later steaming drunk and just fell into his chair. He soon got to shouting for his dinner and I remember my mum watching him from the kitchen. Soon he was snoring away loudly. She crept up to him and rubbed his moustache with the chop fat.

When he woke up a couple of hours later he started shouting for his dinner again, mum said:

You're drunk Jack, you've had your dinner, look at the fat you've got dripping onto your best shirt.  He got up and stumbled to bed.
//
I stopped going to my tattoo artist because he started to act sexually towards me
**
I have about 60% of my body tattooed and I had a great tattoo artist who had done almoust every tattoo I have. He tattooed me like 3 years and we became friends. 

About 6 months ago he did my chest tattoo and at the same time he was tattooing me I noticed that his hands touched places that should not be touched. He acted like it was accident everytime. I started to feel uncomfortable. After he was done I decided not to go take tattoos from him anymore. After couple of weeks when I didnt contact him anymore he started to text me. He sended me messages about how he will tattoo me free if I send him nudes or answer his dirty questions. That was the moment when I blocked him everywhere and started to look another tattoo artist.
Im kinda ashamed that I let him touch me like that while tattooing but I was totally freezed.


Edit: thank you so much telling me that I should report him. I was little scared to do it before, but know I know its the right thing to do.
Also you guys are so lovely

I got my whole class in trouble because of a penis
**
So in primary school, my class used to bully me because my parents were divorced. One day I had enough and came up with a scheme.
Every week we'd have "grammar and punctuation day" where we'd go into groups and read to eachother a text the teacher gave us, after 20 minutes, we'd hand the texts around until we got a new one.

On the last rotation, my group got a text on the silverback gorilla. On my sheet of paper, I drew a small penis in blue ink and went to the teacher about it.
The teacher then got everyone except me out of the class and discussed with them on graffiti and vandalising, and if no one came forward on who drew the dick, they'd all have to pick up rubbish at lunch time.
No one came forward and everyone except me picked up rubbish that day.

Then a week later we had a company give a talk to the whole year group on why you shouldn't vandalise and etc.

I was very proud of myself.
//
My buddy and I got high and spit roasted his girlfriend for a few hours. Apparently she wants to do it again but both he and I are apprehensive.
**
So we're all adults in our late 20's. I was at their place hanging out last Saturday and he had some weed which is legal in our state and we all enjoy so we all got very stoned. Well his girlfriend sat down in between us and she started rubbing both of us. I got weirded out and my buddy said, "It's cool." Then she unzipped us both and started sucking and stroking us for awhile and eventually we spit roasted her switching sides every once in awhile. 

Well eventually we all fell asleep and woke up. Things were kind of awkward but I ended up leaving. My friend and I talked about it and he said we were cool but it was kind of awkward with us both being dudes and being straight but he said his girlfriend wants to do it again. Obviously he and I aren't interested in having sex with eachother but his girlfriend is hot and definitely enjoyed both of us at the same time. 

I might do it again.

Teacher got me good but took 24 years to figure it out
**
First grade fumble

So In the first grade my teacher gave everyone an assignment to go home and take notes on water boiling . Come in the next day and find out  half the class was told to boil the water on high heat with salt in the water the other half to boil theirs in medium heat. My confession is it took me until today at 31 years old to realize the kids who were told to add salt on high heat were all the best most attentive students , us half heaters were the talkative trouble makers... long story short the teachers form of payback was forcing us assholes to go home and watch water boil twice as long as the respectful kids
//
I have no respect for people who can't co-parent peacefully, especially women
**
Do I love my ex-husband? No.

Do I like him? Not really.

Would I ever get back together with him? Never.

And I am sure he feels the same way about me.

&#x200B;

But he is a good father and while we might differ on some things, we share the same objective of raising our kids as best as we can. He's respects me and I respect him. It makes me (and him) cringe having to sit next to him at our kid's graduation ceremony, but we know it means a lot to our son to see both parents co-existing peacefully as oppose to seeing us yell and scream at each other in the parking lot like other separated parents do? It's just funny because I've met other moms (and it's only other women) who tried to "mommy shame" me because I have 50/50 custody. Like I'm ashamed that the father of my kids wants to be involved as much as me or that I shouldn't enjoy my peace and quiet during the week?

I really pissed this girl off when I was in high school.
**
19/M/2005

I had decided to grow out my hair in high school. In my senior year, it was about shoulder length, very curly. One day I was walking to the bus stop during some heavy snowfall. The curls had accumulated a lot of snow. I got on the bus and sat down. At this point I found a hair tie in my pocket. I leaned forward and flung my head back to get my hair behind me. As I was putting in the tie, I got a hard smack to the side of my face. I turned around to see who hit me to find a girl who's hair, face and shirt were covered in the wet snow that came of my hair. She was fuming. Super pissed. I immediately apologized and felt really bad. Didn't even care that she smacked me. I deserved it. Anyway, a few months later she  got trampled to death by a horse. Either that or it was her twin sister, never could tell them apart.

There has been a spider in my bathroom for 1 month. I refuse to kill him.
**
I named him Philip. Every time somebody uses the bathroom they tell me to kill him - but I make excuses and won’t do it.

He is like my roommate, but instead of paying rent he protects me from the other gross Florida creatures like mosquitoes.

Philip, if you’re reading this - thanks man!

Edit: I don’t have time to respond to everyone, i’m sorry - but I will try to read everything. Thanks for my first Silver. ^_^

Edit 2: After many requests, here is a picture of good ol’ trusty Philip.
https://imgur.com/gallery/BEv5QUJ
If anyone can identify him (I live in central florida) pm me!

Edit 3: I'm so sorry I can't response to everyone, but I appreciate all of your wholesome spider posts - and I've read every single one! Also, thank you to whoever gave me gold. I didn't expect this post to go so crazy! Also, after talking with a few people - I'm pretty sure Philip (or Patricia if he/she is a female) is a Red House Spider.

Today's the second time I've slept in for a Zoom class. I'm the teacher.
**
I'm such a goddamn moron y'all. 

It wasn't intentional, but it makes perfect sense. I'm awful with time management, have bad insomnia, and underestimate how many times I'm willing to get up and turn off every single alarm of mine before going back to bed. I'm so willing, in fact, that I don't even fucking remember *waking up* at all. 

It's the first class that I'm teaching. Ever. During a pandemic. After a nasty, painful break-up. While dealing with some really personal and troubling realizations. I hate this shit man. I just wish the classes were later. I need to fight to get schedule for 10am or later. Fuck me. 

I guess I wanna tell myself these are really stressful circumstances and things are going to shit, but it's fucked to be disrespectful like this to my students. They actually like me, and are engaged and willing and hardworking. Fuck me in the dick with barbwire godfuckingdammit.

I'm quitting heroin today
**
I've been living a secret Life for two months and today, I'm done. I'm choosing to quit heroin today. I've been ana addict since I was 16, and have struggled through many substances. Meth has always been my go to but since it's so obvious when someone smokes meth, I started smoking heroin so no one suspected anything. Not even my fiancee. And I'm a horrible person but I'm not going to tell him. I can do this. it's going to be hard, I'm going to be miserable and hate my life but it's only going to last a short while. A few weeks of my life to save the rest of it, it's gonna be worth it. I blocked my connect, slowly removed the shitty people in my life and today I am ready.

I appreciate support, encouragement, advice, tips. Because you'll are the only ones that know my dirty secret.

I touched my cat’s paws last night
**
Buckle up. When I adopted my cat, she came to me declawed. I think that issue, coupled with the fact that she is a cat, makes her not like her paws to be touched. 

Last night, I had trouble sleeping. Whenever she hears me awake, she comes into my room, lays on my chest, and does soft kneads on my neck. Further tempting me with the soft paws. I normally lay there and respect their forbidden touch status. But the proximity of them this time was just too much to bear. 

I took a risk. A big risk. With BOTH of my index fingers, on BOTH of her paws, AT THE SAME TIME, I stroked those paws. And guess what?? She let me. 

I was in absolute shock after the first stroke, unbelievably thrilled after the second stroke, became mildly terrified & confused after the third stroke, and stopped. I don’t know why she let me. I don’t know why I tried. I will be chasing this high for the rest of my life.

When I was in highschool I purposely got my girlfriend (now wife) pregnant.
**
We were 17 and in love when our son was born. We had practiced safe sex and she was on birth control and we used condoms.

I quit school to work at the steel mill with my dad and provide for my family. At 18 I asked her to marry me and she said yes and we've been together ever since (12 years ago now) and have 3 children together but what she didn't know until recently is that I poked a hole in the condom. She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever met and I wanted to be with her forever and in my fucked up teenage head poking a hole in the condom was the way to ensure she'd be in my life forever. Years later I realized how shitty that was especially since it worked so I told her the truth. She laughed and said, "I wasn't ever on birth control. I lied." Then we both laughed. I guess we trapped eachother and we're both shitty people. God I love her.
//
My mother in law is a ‘reverend’ and I have enough evidence to completely ruin her career
**
My mother in law has been spending the past 2/3 years getting multiple degrees to become a reverend so she can begin preaching. 

The thing is, she is INSANELY verbally abusive to my fiancé. I have more than an hour worth of videos of her abusing her son and abusing me, including a ton of ableism, racism, fatphobia etc. 

I could easily email these videos to every church she plans to preach. Email these to people who look up to her. I could post these videos online and destroy all the effort she’s put in to be seen as some godly woman. 

And quite frankly I have the right mind to do so. After everything she’s done to my fiancé. Everything she’s done to me. Everything she’s done IN FRONT of our two year old daughter. 

She holds literally every single penny she spends on our daughter or her son over our head no matter if we asked for her to spend it or not (it’s more often than not that we DIDNT ask her) 

I might just upload these videos. Show the world how she really is.
//
I lied about the date of my abortion to stop the biological father's family harassing me.
**
My abortion isn't for a couple of days yet but the bio father and his toxic family have been getting their friends and church people (I don't know what the collective term for people who go to their church is lol) to send me messages harassing me to try and convince me to continue with the pregnancy and give the bio father's mother the baby. I'm not putting my body through hell just to give these horrible people the baby and I also do not care about their opinions so I eventually just told them I'd already had the abortion and the harassment pretty much ended (still get a couple of "you'll burn in hell"s and things lol).
//
My Fiancé and I got married today.
**
Our wedding is planned for June. Realistically we don’t think that’ll happen anymore but we’re still holding out hope. But in the meantime we decided why wait - because if it gets canceled in June and everything is locked down we won’t be able to get married. So, we decided let’s do it now while we can. The only people who know are our witnesses - we’re not telling anyone else in case our original plans still work out. But I guess I’m telling all of Reddit instead. While the world is melting down around us, we chose love.

Edit: I’ve offended quite a few people by putting this as a confession. I guess I figured if our families found out and close friends, they’d be upset they couldn’t be there. So it kind of seemed like something we shouldn’t do. Regardless, I get that it’s not a true confession. But still, thanks to all of you that could look past that and be happy for us. And thanks for the gold! Stay healthy everyone!

Calling my bf daddy in my sleep
**
I (18F) refuse to call my boyfriend daddy. I think it's kinda fuckin weird idk. Not to kinkshame anyone else that does it, I just called my father daddy when I was little, so calling my s/o daddy during sex turns me off; However, it was brought to my attention, that  I've been rolling over to face my bf in my sleep and saying "Daddy I had a nightmare, can I sleep with you?"


My boyfriend just thinks I'm secretly into DDLG. The truth is, I was just a daddy's girl and lived on base with my dad when until he committed suicide when I was in seventh grade. I have reoccuring dreams about crawling in bed with him after having a nightmare. It's not a sexual thing, I just miss my dad a lot and am not ready to have that conversation with him yet.
//
I catfish girls in relationships and expose them to their boyfriends when they send nudes or send sexual messages
**
This is my first post here

Before you comment, just know I don't go out of my way to message random girls on Fb or Instagram, I only take them from 
Tinder and some random dating websites.

I was cheated on 2 years ago and guy who my ex was cheating with found out about me and told me and I was eternally grateful, so now I am actively trying to return favor to random people. I am in relationship now and my gf knows about me doing it and she even encourages it.

I sometimes think if I do the right thing, because I never meet those girls irl and I never will know if they only flirt online and would never actually cheat, but I feel like sending nudes or sexual messages is enough of a reason to expose them to their boyfriends.

I am pretty sure that 6-8 relationships have ended because of me and often I even feel bad for it at first, but I almost always get thankful responses from the guys which makes me want to keep doing what I am doing

I did a monster check for my 7 year old and had my own anxiety attack from it.
**
I live in a 115 year old house, and has the original woodwork and all that. My 7 year old hears me walking and gets scared there’s a monster so I do what any good dad does and comforts him by telling him I’ll go check for monsters.

Last night, he said he heard a noise in the basement, which is unfinished and honestly a little creepy. So I went down and looked with no lights on to prove to him there’s nothing to be afraid of. 

I told him I would count to 100 down there and be okay. 

I went down, turned off all the lights and counted to 100. The moment I turned the lights off, I had incredible panic that there was something there but persisted to 100. 

As I went up stairs, I fought every urge to run up the stairs as not to freak him out. He went to bed satisfied that there were no monsters. 

I did not.

I now leave my basement lights on all the time. 

Please don’t steal my post for your purposes.

I have an old lady’s voicemail saved on my phone so I can listen to it when I need to hear a comforting old person
**
So the story behind this voicemail - I bought I little painting from an old lady a few years back, and gave her some extra money for a tip. She was shocked, and told me I shouldn’t do that, but I insisted. So she insisted she goes a buys the painting a frame. It took a few days, and I’d go back to the place to see if she had gotten it done, and her husband would be there and would update me. I left my number to make things easier, and I get a call from her one night and the voicemail goes a little like this - “hi honey I was out and realized it was dark and I can’t drive after dark so I went home I’m so sorry I will have the frame tomorrow I’m so sorry I love you I apologize again take care”. She ended up also getting me a cute Christmas card to go with it.

I lost all of my grandparents years ago, so having that voicemail is just kind of nice.
//
My dog saved me from suicide.
**
I was home alone besides my cat and dog. I was holding a bottle of opioid pain killers and a glass of water. I was going to down all 40 of them when my dog walked in and rested her head on my legs. I pushed her out of my room but she refused to leave me alone, she whimpered and looked at me as I held the bottle in my hands. I got up, put the bottle away, drank the water and cried while cuddling my dog. She didn't leave me until my mum got home. She's such a good girl.

(EDIT) thank you everyone for all of your kindness, seeing all the rewards, the likes, the karma, the comments made me cry. I've realised that people are so caring. Please help anyone who is suffering from depression or anxiety you never know who you could help.

I feel so ashamed that people on Reddit helped me last year
**
I was released from prison in 2018. A year later, I was staying at a shabby studio and living from paycheck to paycheck. I posted something about returning groceries that I had bought after I got fired (company was downsizing). vA few people felt sorry and offered me money. I declined.  I was just wondering if I could return stuff that I had bought days before. Eventually, I did accept some money just to get by.

I did find another job because my criminal background didn't appear on the background check. I just finished my one year anniversary and make close to 70K a year. I really don't worry about money and can buy myself nice things. Despite all that, I am forever ashamed that I got so desperate that I was going to return groceries and there aren't too many people who understands what that's like.

My girlfriend doesn’t know:
**
Christmas is just around the corner and my girlfriend has no idea I sold both my drone, My VR and the few collectors edition items that survived my house fire of last year to buy her a gaming computer and build it for her because she told me how it reminded her of simple times and how she misses being able to just lose herself while playing games, Her anxiety and depression have been so bad lately she’s been nearly crippled, It’s 7am and I’ve been pretending to sleep for the last 5 hours watching her play dragon age and talk to old friends on discord laughing and living, I’m so happy I could make her feel comfortable and herself again.

Edit 1: The reason this is a confession and I posted it here because she has no idea I sold the things, she thinks I found a good deal and I wouldn’t wanna make her stress about things, Relax incels

Being a cam girl might have ruined my life but I don't regret it
**
I was a cam girl before Onlyfans was a thing (a few years ago). I made decent money during my gap year off of it. It was fun, I got to be cute and sexy and laugh on camera for money! But I have a vanilla job and I'm in a STEM grad program at a T25. I am constantly worried about when someone will blackmail me or ruin everything I've worked so hard for with one screenshot. I can't make a Youtube. I can never be on TV.  I'm nervous when I get a lot of likes on Instagram, fearful that the wrong person might recognize me. 

But... if I ever get exposed, I hope it happens when I can spin it like Kim K. When I can show the world that women can be smart and sexy at their own discernment. I want to be famous for having done whatever the fuck I wanted and doing it well.

A kind woman gave me $40 for a jacket
**
Many many years ago when I was in high school, I never wore a jacket because I was too cheap and poor even though it's usually around 30s degree F during the wintertime here. One winter as I was walking to school, a woman stopped me. "I see you every morning and you never have on a jacket. Here, take this and buy a jacket with it", she says as she hands me $40. Nice, free money. I took the money a little guiltily, knowing that I had no plans on spending this money on a jacket. I wanted to spend this money on snacks and activities.

But.. the more I thought about it I realized that this woman's route obviously passes me every morning. I didn't want her to see my without a jacket. So grudgingly I went out and bought a jacket with the money even though I didn't think I needed it.

Ended up using this jacket for many years and I always think back fondly about how I met such a kind warm hearted woman.

I ordered a pocket pussy and I am super excited to use it
**
Temp account I have a brother who knows my reddit account..

Anyway I ordered 2 items actually. One that is like a face and it ''should'' simulate a blowjob and a pocket pussy.

I am a 16 year old virgin. Never had a girlfriend but I want to but im am socially awkward.

I really am excited to use the pocket pussy to kindn of feel what it feels like but I know it 100% wont feel like the real thing.

I probably end up being ashamed of myself after using it couple of times but im just so horny and I can use my hands which I do but I wanted something new.

It's coming Monday and so am I on Monday :D

My real name is Karen and lately I’ve been hesitating when someone asks my name because I’m scared they’re going to judge me based on it.
**
Honestly it’s hurtful that my name is considered an insult.

Edits: 

For those asking what I am talking about, go here r/fuckyoukaren and here r/fuckingkaren 

For those of you saying any variation of “that’s such a Karen thing to say”, you are doing exactly what I feared would happen. I expressed a genuine emotion, and now I am being called entitled. Sharing a true thought or feeling is the right of every person, critical for real human interaction and connection, and does not make me entitled or unreasonable. The name of this sub is confessions, not rants. 

For those of you offering encouragement and sharing stories about your nice friends and relatives (and pets!) named Karen, I sincerely appreciate your understanding and compassion. It’s people like you that make this world a better place. Thank you.

I visit my sister's online obituary page at least once a week. She died almost 20 years ago when I was 5, and I still feel heartbroken.
**
She was 19 when she died. All I have left of her are a couple of photos, some jewelry, her urn, and that online page. I read the comments from her dad (she's my half-sister), her dad's new wife who never met her, people that were friends with her, and I just wallow for a moment in what could have been. I wanted her to meet my kids. To be there for me through life like sisters should. She was my best friend when I was a kid, I looked up to her. Most of my memories are gone now. But I visit that page, and I stare at her photo, and I feel a little bit closer to her than usual. I wonder what she'd think of me now.


Edit: Thank you to all of those who expressed condolences. I cried reading your responses, especially those of you who shared your own stories of loss. My heart goes out to all of you. And for those of you with negative comments, that's fine. I'm not reading them. I hope you find some empathy.

A girl I was breaking up with told me "I hope you think of me whenever you hear this song" and now I do and laugh at how bad my life would have been if we stayed together
**
As we were breaking up she got all spiteful and said "I hope this song always reminds you of me" but in a really negative way. And 5 years later whenever I hear it I still kinda laugh about it. Yes Karen this song reminds me of how toxic you were.

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up so much, thank you strangers. I'm glad this brought some of you joy. 

EDIT2: I'd like to add in detail how it actually went. A few hours after we broke up she texted me a youtube link to that song and then another text "I hope you think of me whenever you hear this song" and if that just doesn't add to the hilarious melodrama of this story then IDK what does.
//
I sometimes jerk off to man-hating posts like in FDS
**

I have a huge kink for a woman just completely treating me like trash. One day, on my main account, I stumbled onto fds. I started looking at the posts most critical and with the meanest language (pathetic, loser etc) and I became very aroused at the thought of these girls talking to me like that. 

So yeah, it kinda gives me satisfaction that it’ll probably make them mad that their posts to put men down are giving a man pleasure.

Edit: well damn didn’t expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for all the comments and DMs, both mean and nice are appreciated!

Update: they actually posted this on their subreddit and some of the comments are calling me trash and being mean to me, did not expect that but thank you whoever posted and commented

I’ve realized I can get my husband to do more housework by dominating him sexually
**
We’ve been exploring some kinks of his and one of them is me being dominating in the bedroom.

I’ve noticed as I get more bold and tease him more, he’s started doing more around the house like picking up groceries, making dinner, even the laundry which is usually my job.

It’s nice and it’s fun.

Edit: my husband already does his fair share of chores.  I said “more” housework. If my husband didn’t already contribute to the household, I wouldn’t be as attracted to him. Nothing feels less sexy than feeling like your partner’s mom. 

I completely agree with everyone that has pointed out my husband probably feels happy and loved, which gives him extra energy to do more chores. A happy sex life is super important.

I was going to kill myself 2days ago
**
Maybe not a confession as such but no one knows I was planning on ending it all. A week ago my 4 year old wouldn't wake up so I rushed her to hospital where she fell into a coma due to a blood clot caused by chemo. 2 days ago they told me she might be brain dead as she wasn't responding to anything. Obviously I was heart broken and devastated, so I planned on ending it all to be with her, I can't see my life without her.

I've never been so happy to hear that they got it wrong, she's awake and smiling with no brain damage, I really feel like it's a miracle.
You kicked cancers butt baby girl you can do this!

EDIT: I honestly didn't think anyone would care when I posted this but I'm so overwhelmed with your support, I've been trying to reply to the comments but there is so many, so thank you reddit. ♥️♥️

Caught my brother smoking weed when I was 7, he said he was smoking grass, so later my friend and I rolled up a bunch of lawn trimmings and smoked it
**
My brother was almost 7 years older than me, and when I was 7, I caught him smoking the jazz tobacco  with our neighbour behind the garage. When I asked what he was doing he told me "smoking grass, don't say anything to mom and dad".  Later that afternoon my best friend and I used my dad's cigarette roller and a bunch of cut up grass to smoke ourselves a nice grassy smoke. 

She ended up puking and I felt sick to my stomach. I smoke mmj now and everytime I think of that and giggle over my idiot child self.

ETA: Holy this blew up. So glad to see all these other little tokers smoking random stuff in the spirit of adventure! Thank you for the awards!
//
My life is so pathetic that I excitedly told my mom I got my first award on Reddit
**

I am thirty years old. 


She had no idea how actually pointless that was and told me I did a good job.


I don’t even know why I exist anymore.


Edit: Hi guys. I did not expect this to get as much traction as it did unless I was getting fully roasted. You are all so positive and the amount of awards on this is absurd. Thank you so much for being so kind. And the few people who said I’m lazy or whatever, I just got dealt a shitty brain that makes living seem impossible sometimes. Dreams and potential occasionally have to get put on the back burner if it means keeping your life even half assed together or at the very least, staying alive.

Dick Chicken
**
I live at home with my mother, step father and younger brother. We are an Italian American family living in NYC and therefore a quarter of our meals involve chicken breast cutlets. My mother is the most picky eater on the planet (4/5 of her orders at restaurants are “wrong”) and absolutely hates thick chicken cutlets. Because of her Brooklyn accent it sounds like she’s saying dick chicken instead of thick chicken and for the past 6 months every time there is an instance of thick chicken in conversation (which happens way too much) my brother and I say dick instead of thick and she hasn’t noticed yet. I’m 29 years old.

My wife is a champ (nsfw)
**
I’m going to try to keep this short and sweet. Today was my birthday. I was getting into it with my wife. She likes anal, I like giving it to her. Needless to say, after a good bit of foreplay I’m inside her rear. Get a couple drinks in me, I like some light anal play myself.

Wife suggests the dildo for myself. I think to myself (in my half-baked drunken stuper) why not? I’m not a small guy and with plenty of lube she enjoys the hell out of so I’m sure I can enjoy it. Wrong 

Ouch.. ouch ouch ouch OUCH. Jesus my ass still hurts. It’s not a big dildo, and she’s taking me like nothing.

How the fuck does she do it? I’ve torn her the hell up and she just loves every second. I tapped out in under 5. My wife is the greatest, and I will never under-appreciate sodomy again.
//
I'm a night security guard and I get paid to jerk off every night.
**
Yep you read that right. I jerk off every night I'm on shift. My supervisor will check in over the walkie sometimes which sucks. He has done so right as I'm about to cum and ruined it for me which sucks but being paid a living wage while jerking off is worth being blue balled occasionally.

Once a night in the camera room where I'm stationed I pull out me dick and pull up some porn on my phone and go to town. I always stop by a coffee stand on the way to work so I usually cum in the coffee cup then put the lid back on and throw it out. After doing this job for years the company has probably paid me thousands to jerk off at this point. That makes every orgasm even sweeter. Just last night I shot ropes so hard in that cup thinking about how great my life is that I get paid to cum.

Edit: Thanks for the love and support guys. I'm gonna crank extra hard while on shift tonight just for you all. Keep on rockin' 🤘

The first time I’ve seen my dad cry.
**
I’m not using a throw-a-way account for this but yesterday I was talking to my dad. I tell him something and he asks me “ You know id die for you, right?” And I didn’t think that. I told him “Well, only if absolutely necessary.” And he said “Josh,” And then just stopped. Then he just sat there for a minute, now mind you my father is 53 and he has never cried in my life time (or at least I don’t recall anything) and he just started balling up and just said” josh, you are my everything, I’d give up my life *snap* just like that if it meant you would be spared by this cruel world. He just told me that he loved me and then just cried and cried. I gave him a hug and he then told me “I’m sorry” and I told him everything that I haven’t told him, like how I’m afraid of telling him things, and how I’m scared of him. I haven’t seen my father cry ever because he hides his emotions all the time, like how he loves me. I love my father and he loves me, we have hung out all day today.

I literally just pissed the bed and I'm mad as hell
**
It's 6 am on my day off I was having some weird ass dreams and I was like, alright y'all imma go to the bathroom, just thinking I was awake even though I was a fucking Ghostbuster. I started going and was confused I didn't hear anything then just woke the fuck up all wet. I'm hella pissed I'm a fucking adult and should know better than this shit ugh.

E- Thanks for all the advice and similar stories to make me feel better! I'm now even more pissed that my porn account is now tainted with popular bed wetting. Also I'm fine medically. My pee is red just like everyone else's urine. Wow and I have an award on my porn account! Love it. Fuck you guys.

Ev2- I have medicine for my UTI now since I almost pissed the bed again this morning. imma keep talking with y'all, cause ya some cool fucks, but unless I have an astronaut dream and pee in space I'm done with my bladder updates. Don't feel bad about peeing, everyone does it or almost does it. Except for those two assholes shaming people, you guys are terrible but at least you don't pee the bed!

My [M] ex-girlfriend's first language was not English. I did not have the heart to correct her during sex.
**
Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ehbbjx/update\_my\_m\_exgirlfriends\_first\_language\_was\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ehbbjx/update_my_m_exgirlfriends_first_language_was_not/)

I would usually try to gently correct her English if she said something incorrectly, and I knew she was embarrassed every time. She learned most of her English from movies and books -- but obviously you don't really learn about common phrases to say during sex.

During one of the first few times we had sex, she knew I was about to come and said, "eject it into my 'vajeena'!" Of course I did not want to correct her, so every time in the future, I would tell her that she was going to make me "eject"...

This was years ago, but still sticks with me...

I horribly insulted a stranger and it still haunts me at times.
**
I once had a really fat person in front of me at McDonalds. She ordered an massive amount of food. Looks at the cashier and says: "I'm going to have a diet Coke with that." At this moment my brain just failed me and I said out loud:  "This will not help anymore" I was petrified. She turned around and looked me straight in the eye. Didn't say a word. I didn't look away, but in the corner of my eye saw the cashier dart out of the room, trying not to burst out laughing. She turned back and left after she got her order. This has been a couple of years ago, and it still haunts me at times. I'm torn between it being one of the most evil things I've ever said to anyone, and being the my bravest moment of speaking the truth were I should not have.
I am sorry.

I only go to my local bar to get hugs from the cute bartender because I'm so touch starved.
**
Yes she's hot and very sweet and but she's not into men at all. Still, she always touches my hand, touches my shoulder, gives me hugs and compliments.  I know she's just doing her job but sometimes it's the only thing close to physical affection I get for weeks on end.  I have to stop myself from hugging her too hard or too long. She's a nice person and I don't want to make it weird, she's like that with most of the regulars so I know I'm not special in any way. But man you don't realize how much you miss affectionate touch until you get it.  It's like water in the desert.  I wonder how many of the other regulars are like me.

My son died and I don't know what to do
**
It had seemed impossible for my wife and I to have a kid before she gave birth to our beautiful boy Robert. It still feels like yesterday when we brought him back to our apartmdnt for the first time. But just a few weeks ago, I was in my car driving him to daycare on my way to work when my car was struck as I was driving through an intersection. The other driver was drunk. Apparently he was killed immediately after contact, which gives me hope that he did not suffer. He was only 3. I have no idea how to do anything. I mostly just sit around and cry. I dont know how to comfort my wife. My life just feels so empty.

edit: Thank you for your support. I have been looking through all of the comments and am currently looking into some different options for therapy
//
You. Are. Killing. Them.
**
If there is one kink I will shame it's the fat fetish. Especially the feedee/feeder kink. If you are a feeder, I have news for you; you are actively working to kill your partner. It isn't healthy, it isn't beautiful and you need to stop.

I am saying this as someone who currently weight 400+ pounds. I have struggled with my weight for about 25 years. I am 38. I am not healthy and I know that. Stop killing the person you love for the sake of a kink. Honestly, I think you should be charged with, at the minimum, voluntary man-slaughter if your partner dies from your actions.

That's it. Thanks for reading.  


Edit: To clarify, I have never blamed another person on my own weight issues. I caused my weight by myself by over eating and being sedentary. These are things I'm trying to fix. The confession here is not about that it's about my feeling that what these people are doing should either be criminal, for the feeder, or, at the very least, cause for the feedee to be put into a psych ward for proper mental help.

My crush didn’t send me any texts from the day I stopped talking with her.
**
I cut of communication with my crush for my own good. I had removed all my social medias as well. Only recently it has come to my attention that she never sent me a text since I stopped initiating the conversations. I was talking so much with her and thought we might have atleast become good friends but I guess it was all in my head. Making peace with your reality is tough and heartbreaking.

Edit: 
I had told her my true feelings before I stopped talking to her. I understand that she did not want a relationship and not everyone can be good friends that’s fine. I’m sad cause it hurts to see that it was all in my mind and I was making things out to be better than they actually were. 

Not asking anyone to hate her. It’s just that I never realized the pain will last this long and change my life weirdly. I have space so that I can live my life in ease and that why only recently it came to my attention that she has not texted anything, it’s sad that it’s this way but it’s nit wrong. Reality can hurt but rationally I can’t complain.

I've lied to my blind best friend for a couple years
**
So my buddy from high school was in a bad car crash in 2014 and ended completely blind. 

He's had to adapt to his new life in many ways. 

It was obviously not easy for him and he was starting to go downhill, he would avoid getting out of his house at all cost and started to drink a bit too much. 

That's until he met, let's call her Clara.

She's a really good girlfriend  she's smart, carrying, funny, has a decent job and most importantly she makes him happy again! 

Now, my friend is a bit shallow and really cares about appearance (I do realize the irony...) so the first time he introduced her to me he asked me how she looked like and I convinced him that she was really attractive when in reality she's very not. She's not hideous but just really odd looking.  

I figured she makes him happy. Why not let him think he's dating a young Angelina Jolie?

I always try to be as positive as I can for others because I lack people who are positive for me
**
I’m not trying to fish for likes or anything I just wanted to make a confession. I lack a lot of positivity in my life. I work really hard to constantly be positive because I don’t really have many people who are there for me. So I love to comment on people’s photos and post on whatever social media and be super positive. I know how just one comment can go a long way so I make a habit of it. I’ve been dealing with depression for 14 years now, starting when I was 6. I’ve always had a rocky relationship with positivity, love and kindness in my life. And while I hate it I don’t want others to feel as alone as I did. That’s why I always try to say something nice to another person whenever I can. I do it even when I don’t know them and even if I don’t like them. Everyone deserves love and positivity and maybe my comment makes a difference. Who knows maybe it’s made someone day, I know others have done that for me too.

I won thousands of dollars on a scratch ticket.
**
When I was in my early 20s I won over 15k on a scratcher. I spent a lot of it on weed and beer, but I also bought my mom a used Subaru and lied to her about where I got it from. I told her a friend gave it to me in exchange for my paintings.... Now she thinks I'm a successful artist and has recently asked me if I could sell any more artwork so I can buy her another used vehicle because the Subaru is dying. I make like 30k a year, there's no way I can ever buy her another car.
 
 Edit: wow this post blew up!! Thanks everyone! I appreciate all the comments and the advice. And the awards! Wow. Y'all are too kind :)
 
 To clarify: my mom isn't thinking she's entitled to another car. She just believes I am doing well with my paintings (I'm not) and I can sell them for money (I can't) and maybe I could help her out again like I did before. She is just painfully optimistic about my talents, bless her heart.
 
 Edit again: I'm a girl btw. I think people assume I'm a guy because of the weed and beer.

My dad thinks I get free office supplies, but I just order them off Amazon.
**
I do technically get free office supplies due to my job. And if there are things we aren’t using anymore, I’m free to take them hone. Things like certain size binders, colored folders, sheet protectors, etc. So my dad would ask me for something here and there when I would bring it home. 

He was always super thankful and wanted to make sure I wouldn’t get in trouble, so he never asked for specific things but would just take whatever ‘scraps’ I brought home. 

He would get so excited (he’s an organization nerd, like myself) and it makes my heart happy. 

Now, when he mentions how he needs something from the store, I automatically say “oh I have that left over at work”, and just order it on Amazon.

I can’t tell him though. He would be so mad if he knew I was buying these things new for him. So I just order it, hold it for a few days and then bring it over ‘from work’.  

Totally worth it.

Edited to say thank you for the awards! I was not expecting that. Honestly, my dad is the most awesome person alive and I would order him the moon, if I could. Thank you!
//
I can’t tell my best friend this.
**
I only watch game of thrones for my best friend because he’s so passionate about it and wants to talk a lot about it.


I was part of that 2% population that never watched a single episode. My best friend told me to watch it. He wanted someone to talk to about it and all his friends had already seen all the episodes and didn’t care to discuss.

I only watch it to make him happy so I can hear him speak so passionately about something he enjoys and there’s nothing greater than seeing his reactions and listening to the excitement in his voice. It makes me so happy that he’s happy. 


Edit: wow, didn’t actually expect people to see this nor did I expect the gold and silver so thank you!!! ! Thanks a bunch for a the sweet comments! For those wondering: I’ve just finished season 1. It’s been a busy week so bare with me XD. 

Edit 2: WOW! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Platinum was really unexpected! Thank you from the bottom of my heart❤️. I’m looking forward to my GOT discussions with my best friend and with others!

I denied a stray cat some fish today and I feel like shit
**
So I picked up some fish from a store, went home as always, but a cat (which I'd assume was a stray one) followed me back to my doorstep, and they keep looking at the fish in the bag, so I guess they just wanted some fish. I could have given them some fish and spent the rest of the day in peace, but no I didn't, I just shoo'ed them away, few hours later I recalled what happened and I started feeling like shit, Why the fuck didn't I just give the cat some fucking fish? God they looked so starved looking at my bag.

Tried looking for the cat but I couldn't find them, I know this doesn't seem much to most of you but I never owned a pet. This is the first time an animal has ever wanted something from me, so I was probably just nervous, or anxious, or something. God I wish I could turn back time and just give the cat some fucking fish.
//
I'm breaking up with him
**
Just needed to get this off my chest even better if it's to strangers who dont know me.

I was walking in the cold at 3am two nights ago. He was  awake and knew I was coming back. I live in a rough neighbourhood. I had already told him a creepy guy tried to talk to me. Yet no phone call to check if I'm okay. I asked him to meet me half way. No response. So I promised myself right then if I didn't see him walking down the road towards me I'm done. I was waiting, watching, wanting him to be walking towards me. But I never saw him. What I did see when I got in was him playing around on his computer, and it dawned on me that he truly doesn't give a shit. I could be being stalked down that road at 3am and here was my supposed to be lover just not giving a shit about it. So I'm leaving him. There is more to this story than just that but this was the breaking point for me. As soon as my lease is up in that apartment I'm gone.
//
[Update] I’ve realized I detest my boyfriend
**
I’m not sure if anyone remembers me from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/q08ck2/ive_realized_i_detest_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post but I decided to update. Hope updates are allowed. 

On March 1st, I caught him cheating. So I kicked him out. I informed the other woman that he wasn’t actually single, too. She was horrified. 

He didn’t take it well. He blamed me, of course. When he realized that I was serious about ending things, he started to choke me, but the dog intervened thankfully. He’s my hero. 

So he’s gone. I got a new job, then a promotion and a raise and I’m going to spend time by myself - at least a year. Get some therapy, heal, figure out my own issues so that I don’t fall into this pattern again if I decide to date in the future. 

Thanks for all the advice and support. I’m scared and sad and tired but I’m also excited to see what life has in store for me.

Edit - seriously you guys are amazing. This is why I l or Reddit <3

I've lied my entire adult life to friends work and the woman who's become my wife.
**
So as the title states, I told a lie years ago to get a job. I was doing my apprenticeship for work and my dad had a heart attack, and suffered a stroke at the same time.

I was third year in my apprenticeship but was being screwed around by restaurant owners signing me off on modules. So when my dad got sick he had insurance but it was through his union and they were dragging their feet in paying and he was going to lose the family home. So I applied for jobs and then just told the owners and chef's I was qualified.

I got a job and was making about $1200 a week working like 75 hours a week, I worked there for 2 years and it was a busy place so I earnt my stripes you know, so next job told the lie again, and again and again till ten years later I've lied my way into job after job and told all my friends and even my missus that I have my paper's.

I'm really good at my job. I'm head chef of a really well known restaurant and have been for a year and a half, I've worked there 5 years and no one knows this secret.

Popular snobby mean girl from my childhood will never know how much her father disliked her.
**
I grew up with a girl who was better than everyone else.  Her father would chat me up at the gas station I worked at in my twenties.  He would divulge how much his daughter’s choice in career and boyfriend disappointed him.  I then would tell him that she was hard to get along with and kind of mean.  Every time I’d see him he’d have a new story about her idiot soon to be son-in-law, or how she was high maintenance. Her father was sweet nice guy.  The father passed away from cancer soon after.  I’m FB friends with the daughter and she really grieves her deceased father annually.  I’m probably one of two people that knows he was exhausted with her.  I feel the weight of the secret every time she posts about her husband and father.

Edit:  The daughter was my sister’s best friend and as a group we shared activities, went to the same school, carpooled etc. I wasn’t a stranger and he’d walk to the gas station to buy coffee in the morning.

NNN made me do some gay shit.
**
So for context I'm 22, male and in college. My roommate in the dorm is out of town on and I've been doing NNN but I also quit taking my anti depressants so my sex drive went through the roof. In one of my classes there's this femboy who always hits on me and he started talking to me and flirting outside my dorm. He has a really feminine ass and appearance and after 2 weeks of NNN and stopping my anti depressants my cock has constantly been hard and throbbing.

He wanted to come in my dorm and next thing I know he's sitting on my couch with me and my cock is in his mouth. It felt so good that I accidentally came really quickly and he kept sucking and I came a 2nd time immediately after. I was still hard and horny and ended up fucking his ass on the couch and came in the condom I wore. He left shortly after but my post nut shamehit me really hard. I'm really not into dudes I just think he has an ass like a girl and I'm hornier than I have been in my whole life.

He keeps looking at me with a sly smile whenever I see him and it's awkward. What do I do now?

After the wife goes to bed the dark knight rises.
**
My wife and I live on the 3rd/top floor of our apartment. There is a roundabout and relatively popular road right behind our apartment below our balcony. Every night after my wife falls asleep I'll turn out all the lights in the living room (that way you can only see my outline from the road.)  and I'll go and stand on my deck and loom at all the people who drive by. Usually from 11:30 PM  12:27 AM. Idk why I do this, but its fun. I hope they see me and it really just gives them a story to tell when they get to their destinations. "How was your drive?" "Fine, I guess." "Was that guy out at that apartment again?" "Yes!, we have to move into a better neighborhood." When it rains I wear a poncho and let it flap in the wind.  Not the most scandalous confession ever, but I probably don't want my loved ones knowing about this particular hobby of mine. 

Tldr: Every night I'll stand on my balcony in the dark and stare at ongoing traffic.

Edit: thanks for the love guys! I had no idea my weirdness would blow up!

I didn’t know the “corn” in “corn dog” meant it was made out of cornbread until I was 26.
**
Update: 

Okay since so many people obviously never knew this also figured I would tell the story about how I found out. 

My wife and I were at a Cookout (North Carolina fast food chain) drive-through and I ordered like I usually do. A cookout tray: spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and a corn dog. As we were waiting to pay I just randomly thought,” I wonder why corn dogs, are called corn dogs?” So I asked my wife expecting her to say she didn’t know. 

She replied,” Because the hot dogs are battered in corn bread mix and deep fried.  The “corn” in “corn dog” means corn bread.” 

At this moment my mind was completely blown. 

I just looked at her with this look of astonishment. Just thinking there’s no way I spent the past 26 years of my life eating corn dogs, and cornbread, and never putting two and two together. I had no words and just couldn’t wrap my head around it!

The way she acted made me feel like I was the only one to not know that, so it’s nice to know I’m not alone here!

MY husband shaved his beard and mustache and instantly became a 2
**
I know I sound shallow  but he also looks spitting image to his dad  who ALWAYS is shaven so I'm even more taken a back.

it's been two days and I'm like if he wanted to talk to me  back then minus the beard would I have said yes?(EDIT**: I ask because when  I met him I went on the first date because of my initial attraction  to himobviously i got know him more and married him for other things than looks   )** 

**EDIT: Guys you're right i am a bitch that's why i confessed hopefully for some humbling and to get it out my system** 

obviously im not going to divorce him  he has other qualities I married and love him for.

I got covid and I'm pissed as fuck
**
So last Monday I tested positive for Covid. And even worse, I got it from my father. I've been very careful since March, I was in London Uk for the netire lockdown period and it really mentally fucked me up so in june I managed to fly home to stay with my family until it blows over. So been mad careful, no contact with strangers, mask wearing everywhere etc, so all the guidelines and then some. And then last week a guy that had been in close contact with a covid positive, he went to work and he works with my father so infected my father and he brought it to our family. Now I'm in bed, fever, no taste no smell, coughing, foggy, exhausted, all the symptoms and all I can think is how pissed I am at these idiots who can't take the simple precautions and stay home when they know they might be a carrier. If it were up to me I would make it a criminal offense and anyone who knowingly didn't take precautions can be criminally prosecuted for negligence. If people can't care about others on their own, well then put them in jail for 30 days and watch them change their tune.

My wife killed herself, and a part of me is glad she did.
**
The title is a bit misleading. I loved and love my wife more than anyone in my life. We’d been married for 22 years. When we first got married, she was a very happy person. Very bubbly, eccentric. She’d go out of her way to help anyone. But before she committed suicide, she went very downhill. Mentally and physically. She became depressed, anxious, lost lots of weight and was very unhappy. Her doctor put her on Prozac which made everything worse. I tried and tried and tried to help her but she ended up committing suicide when I was away at work. I am deeply saddened but I know that she is in a better place now, not depressed anymore.

Found out my bully in high school became a teacher
**
My high school years came to the point where I was put under observation in high school because I was seen as a threat to myself. Truth was I was getting bullied constantly and just wanted a way out. 
The councillor finally got me to talk about it and he was dragged into the room to talk about it. He claimed that he was “just having a laugh”. But now he just has something else to pick on me for. 

Anyway, a friend of mine told me he tried to become a teacher. If he actually succeeded, I’ve been thinking about what I’d actually do it him. Maybe shout it from the social media rooftops Until it destroyed his career? Who knows.

Fuck you Diego, fuck you mother
**
My half brother (his name is Diego) sexually abused me when I was seven years old, he told me not to waste time accusing him, since no one was going to believe me, I am currently 21 years old, I had not said that to anyone until one day my mother  I wonder why I hate Diego, I decided to tell her, absolutely everything, my mother said she believed me, but in December she confessed that she never believed me, that I only made up that lie to harm her beloved son. She has always preferred Diego, even knowing that he is a drug addict, a thief, a thirty-something who sleeps with 15-year-old girls, she still does not believe me, even she compared me to a ruthless Hitler who only wants to hurt his poor Jewish son (She said exactly those words to me) Now I not only hate Diego, I also hate my mother.


P.S. Sorry if my English is not very good.

I had to put my dog down last week and can't bring myself to go home to my empty apartment.
**
I had my dog for 8.5 years and he was the absolute best part of my life during that time. He was the only consistent thing in my life, being with me through the end of high school, all of college for 2 degrees, and multiple moves in the time since college ended. He comforted me through 7 years of abusive relationships and is quite literally the reason I'm still alive today. My boy was afraid of the vet and I made sure that he would be comfortable in his last moments by euthanizing him in our home. He passed away laying in his bed, leaning into me with his head in my arms. I can't be in my apartment without bursting into tears now. It's so empty in there without him. How am I supposed to move on without my best friend?

Edit:

Wow - this blew up more than I ever expected. Thank you all for your kindness. I'm going to take some time and read through each and every comment. I'm so sorry if I don't respond to you all; I'm still doing my best to cope with the loss. I appreciate all of you so much.

I found my mom’s nudes on reddit.
**
My mom told me she had been doing online dating for some time and I didn’t know how I felt about it but I just want her to be happy. But about a month ago I was on reddit and even though it sounds bad I was simply curious, and I searched if there was like a nsfw page on reddit for people that were local. Idk why I looked it up but I guess I was just bored one night and sure enough, I found an r4r subreddit for the city I live in, and the first post I see is literally my mom. It was a mirror selfie of her nude in the bathroom at where she works, face showing and everything. I was in shock for about an hour and even now about a month later, I have no clue what I should do or how I should feel about this information. My mom is my whole world, I love her more than anybody.

I am 34 and have never had sexual intercourse.
**
I got my first girlfriend at 20. When we went to have sex for the first time, we were both inexperienced. I couldn’t get my condom on and my erection disappeared. I got angry and frustrated and threw the unused condom across the room. I thought there was something fucked up with me.

My girlfriend started crying. She took it personally. I went to comfort her. She said something like “Don’t you know I love you?” This was the first time either one of us had said those words. I said “I love you too.” I meant it, I think.

We got married a few years later. But I was too embarrassed to try again. So our sexual lives were mostly performing oral on each other, fingering, etc. So I don’t know if I’m a virgin per se, but I have never had actual sexual intercourse.

Eventually we got divorced (for other reasons in addition to the obvious ones) and now I am in my own. I am a little worried about trying to have sex with a woman. And also what their reaction might be when I tell them
//
I deliberately upset my daughter tonight so my husband could have some success at comforting her and being the "safe" one.
**
Before you jump to conclusions, I didn't physically hurt her, abuse her, call her nasty names, say mean things or anything like that. She didn't want a bath, but I persisted in trying to take her clothes off and get her in (she's 3.5). She was throwing a tantrum, and normally I stop and negotiate alternatives with her when she throws a wobbly. My husband never gets to be the one too be the hero, the comfort and the safe haven. So tonight, rather than negotiate, I pushed the limits. Sure enough, she ran to him, said "No Mummy" and he got to be the one to comfort her. She calmed down and was happy (and didn't have a bath), Daddy was happy that he got to be the provider of cuddles and comfort and I got to have a hot bath on my own. No regrets. But I will never tell my husband this.

Just got blown by a guy
**
So, ever since i was about, 14, I always wondered if i was Bi-sexual. I am 22 (M), and i met a guy using Tinder. He messaged me at 4AM today and asked simply "Do you wanna get blown?" So, there i am, taking a shower, getting dressed to meet him for 5AM.   


Went to a local field, got blown. Blew a load, was easily the best blowjob i've ever had. Though i will say it's not something i'd be down to do again, I can say 100% that i prefer women. But it was a good experience and i now have a great anecdote.   


Just happy i have the closure.   


For anyone out there who is confused about their sexuality.... go find out!

-edit- I mean who knows? Maybe I'll get another blow job from a guy. I kinda just go with the flow. Blowjobs are just great in general. I do what I feel like doing 😊

I Was Going To Kill Myself Today
**
I (M20) was going to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and end it all today. I had left a suicide note under my pillow, and I have pre saved messages that I planned on sending to my family and friends right before I was going to jump. Before I got to the bridge, a friend of mine (a person who I can open myself up to and talk about my problems with) called me and asked to hang out tomorrow. I told him that I'd let him know soon, and he responded with "Ight let me know. I just really want us to hang out when you get the chance." After I got off the phone with him, when turned around and went home. He doesn't even know that he stopped me from killing myself.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I really appreciate  each and every single one of you 🙏

I recently moved out and realized I LOVE being naked
**
Up until I moved out, I didn't even wanna have sex naked. I hated being naked. I wouldn't do it unless I had to. I brought clothes with me to the bathroom when I showered so that I wouldn't have to walk to my room in a towel. 

Now I get naked literally every chance I get. After showers I stay naked as long as possible. I take naps naked, I bake cookies naked, it might be a problem to be honest.


EDIT: I am a female and I live with my boyfriend but I'm still never naked around him, he's gone most weekends and I use that time to be totally naked as much as possible. Still have no desire to be regularly naked in front of anyone, just by myself in the comfort of our living room lol

My Brother And His Girlfriend Tried To Fuck Right Next To Me While I Was Playing Red Dead Redemption
**
Before you read, I'm a girl so ya'll won't be confused.

&#x200B;

Alright, so this is really fuggin' nasty.

&#x200B;

So my brother, his girlfriend, and I were all sitting on my brother's three seat couch. My brother was laying down and his girlfriend just straight up laid on top of him. I was distracted by doing yeehaw things and didn't notice anything until his girlfriend jumped off from him because she thought the door opened. I jumped up too and looked at her. Saw her titties as plain as day. I don't really care about seeing tits because I have some, but WTF. That's nasty that they tried to fuck like a foot away from me .\_.

&#x200B;

And then they both walked behind me to go lay on his bed and while I was doing stuff on the game I started to hear the bed creaking violently and his girlfriend slightly moaning. I glanced over there and his girlfriend just kinda gave me a 'oh shit' look and told my brother to stop.

a guy sent me flowers today
**
I'm a 29F who's never dated. I lost a lot of weight (140 lbs) in the past year and finally got myself on tinder. 

I met this guy. I really like him. We texted every day for a month before I finally said "when are you going to ask me on a date?"

We had our first date a few weeks ago and have another planned for next weekend. He lives an hour and a half away and we're both busy so finding time that works for both of us is hard. 

Today is my birthday, and I'd kind of hoped he would send me flowers but I doubted it would happen. But then I had a missed call from a florist and I got this massive, gorgeous, stunning bouquet of roses and lillies and greenery. And they were from him. 

I feel like a lovesick teenager. My brain keeps wanting to convince me this is all fake but... Maybe this is the real deal. I really really like him and I don't really have anyone to talk to about how over the moon I am for this guy.
//
I confess that this subreddit isn't good for confessions.
**
Examples of top "confessions" on this subreddit right now include:  


\- I would love to cuddle someone right now.

\- I actually want to be desired more than having sex

\- I'm so horny right now you guys zomg

&#x200B;

Like seriously??? Those are not confessions of guilt. They're just lame. I saw a post of a real confession just seconds ago get a downvote. Do you guys really want to see posts like the above? Or would you rather see actual confessions? I can't believe what I'm witnessing here to be honest. 

The mods need to do more to make this subreddit better. The description reads: "Get that nasty secret off your chest". What is a nasty secret about being horny? Everyone is horny. What is the nasty secret about wanting to be desired? Isn't that natural? How is wanting a cuddle a nasty secret????

Sorry if this comes across as a rant, but I feel it needed to be said.

I just had a bowel movement that was roughly a foot and a half long and It is the highlight of my year- no exaggeration.
**
I am chronically ill and suffer with severe autoimmune issues that affect my gut.   It is not abnormal for me to go a month without a movement.  I know this is probably TMI even for this sub, but I finally found a supplement (on top my medications) that actually works, and this just happened a few minutes ago.   I can’t really shout it from the rooftops or post on social media but I felt like I just had to share.  I feel like I can run a marathon right now.  I haven’t had this much relief in YEARS and I think endorphins are pumping through me now.   If anyone suffers from chronic severe constipation, you know how big of a deal this is.  For those that don’t have to deal with this (or other chronic health issues) take it has an example of the little things you should remember to be thankful for...5 years ago I would have never thought pooping would be better than sex or any drug in the world.

I frequently wish I never did Onlyfans. It has greatly impacted my self esteem, even months after stopping it.
**
I did Onlyfans for the majority of 2020. I worked so hard to make the sets, get the photos taken, put together my outfits, vet the photos,  market myself, all of those things. But, I never made any money off it. It impacts my self esteem to this day, I wonder if I'm ugly to people or unattractive. I feel terribly insecure about my body, I feel uncomfortable in my own skin a lot, I feel like a failure and am insecure about the fact that I made no money too. I feel awful whenever I think about it.

Edit: I wanna thank everyone who has replied. The amount of kind words you've given me really gives me a good perspective of things and your words help me combat those thoughts of my own. You know, with reason rather than the over emotional thoughts I've got on the subject. I cannot thank you all enough! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

As of September 30th, 2019, I am officially three years self-harm free.
**
 My last self-harming took place on September 30th, 2016. I was, *am* a cutter. I suppose I always will be, in typical addict fashion, but I have been *"clean"*  for three years now. Typically to my forearms. I started when I was a  child, but if you asked me directly when, I couldn't tell you. I didn't  wear them proudly, or 'for attention'. I constantly wore long sleeves,  and still do to hide my scars -- even in 40C weather. It's not something  I'm proud of, and my family is oblivious, even though I'm now in my  thirties. I managed to hide the scars, and my habit well. I often  required stitches when I went 'too far'. I often contemplated getting  full sleeve tattoos, as I've heard of some self-harmers getting sleeve  tattoos because they 'didn't want to self-harm and ruin their tattoos'.  However, I didn't trust myself enough not to pay the funds for the  tattoos, only to mark them up, or start marking my thighs instead to  avoid ruining the ink.

I can't really tell anyone, so late at night, I'm celebrating a little, and telling the internet, because no one else knows.

My youtube video succeded really well and i have noone to share it to.
**
Hi,

Please, DO NOT GO TO MY CHANNEL.

\-

Okay, why is there no post?

&#x200B;

I casually put here that i'm happy that my mildly shitty youtube video suceeded. I didn't think much about this post, and then...

HOLY SHIET 3.1K UPVOTES?

This is my most upvoted post.

&#x200B;

But to the problem- Some people managed to find my channel and i had like 6 "Here from reddit" comments. I do NOT want my channel to leak.

If i somehow got fe. 500 subscribers from this, i would have like 600 subs and only 10 views on every video (My channel isn't english). If this happened, it would alienate any possible serious viewers. Channel with 600 subs and 10 views seems like it's content sucks, so why bother.

&#x200B;

If you want to help my channel, DO NOT search it.

&#x200B;

I will atleast try to answer some comments now.

&#x200B;

Am i an ungrateful prick for editing a post with over 3000 upvotes? I will leave that up to you.

&#x200B;

Thanks for understanding :)

I (F23) sent a girl my nudes and got a negative reaction.
**

This girl I follow on tiktok I’ve been crushing on for a while.  She has lots of followers and I thought she was super cute.  She posted her Snapchat and said she was accepting nudes and that she liked “all body types”.  I decided for once in my life to be the daring one and sent her a pic of me.  She responded “lose some weight 🤮” and blocked me.  You know that feeling where you’re so hurt you want to ugly cry but only a few tears come out instead of sobbing? Yea. That’s me rn. I’m so embarrassed.  I really wish I could take it back.  Lesson learned.

Edit: I’m not sending my nudes to anyone.  Please stop asking. I have a gross body anyways so nobody’s missing out on anything .

Edit2: I didn’t expect this to blow up and get all the support it did! Thanks everyone for all your supportive comments :)

Edit3: guys I think she or her followers followed me here and found my post.

I am so fucking afraid all the time
**
Nobody knows this, because i have one hell of a pokerface, and im masculine. Like, tall, strong, the "fix it guy" etc. I have chronic panic disorder (had it for 22 years now), and i get crippling panic attacks daily. And i am so fucking terrified of the next panic attack, that its basicly the only thing on my mind. During the last two years my doctor have given me xanax, so now im pretty sure im addicted on top of it. And boy have i read ALL the horror stories. I am so fucking afraid. I dont even know why im posting this, because it feels kinda dumb as im writing it. I just want to tone it down, like 80% or something. Im sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but i havent told anyone just how afraid i am

Edit; holy fuck this thread is blowing up with support. Thank you friendly strangers. Ive got a tear in my eye because of you wholesome fuckers. I never expected this from a forum. Thank you so much. Also special thanks to the bearbros

My husband and I tried pegging. It unfortunately did not go well...
**
I'm 35 and a woman for context. I thought pegging my husband would be hot. It's been something that I fantasized about and I got him onboard to try it. Well last night we tried it and it took a lot of lube to get it in and once I slowly got it in he howled in pain so I backed it out and then he shit everywhere. On the bed, on me and himself. Turns out he had a hemorrhoid he didn't know about and my strap on on hit it and I pulled out in a hurry which made him shit.

It was pretty disastrous. My husband was so embarrassed he got very upset and angry and said we aren't trying again and while I respect his decision and won't try to force it on him I'm really disappointed.
//
I've sang my dog the same song since he was 6wks old knowing I'd sing it when I put him down
**
I chose to not have kids.
Instead I have Bruce. He's a pitsky, half pit half husky, named after Bruce the shark because "people are friends NOT food". 
When someone hears of a song I sing to him, and that I made it up with the intention of singing it through his life for comfort and one day when he's put down, I'm looked at with a strange confusion. I'm an emotional fellow though I keep a fairly good lock on them so they don't run my decisions and I will take his passing very, very, badly. But people have a hard time fathoming my control when they too know level of emotional attachment to him. 
Idk.... I understand everything is temporary and I wanted to be able to give him something of comfort in his scariest moments. If only everyone was so fortunate.

NSFW Childhood sexual awakening
**
I used to watch lesbian porn with my twin and I’d  secretly be rubbing myself while we were watching. I’d destract her by saying I could hear someone at the door so she’d run & check. I don’t exactly remember what awakened up my curiosity but I do remember rewinding Roses nude painting scene in Titanic. After a few years, we started experimenting on each other and I remember licking her out a few times and sucking each other’s toes. There was a common theme we’d both play out where where one was the psychotic rapist and the other one a victim. We’re much older now and haven’t spoken about it since, but we’re both bi and I’ve got some really twisted fetishes.

Edit: Did not expect this to blow up but ok. 

To answer some questions I am a F, we were probably 10-12 and we are biological sisters. This took me some time to admit because it’s shameful but I’m glad there’s a confession page.

I wanna fuck my coworker on shift
**
So I work at a little pizza joint and normally it’s busy and our managers are there. My coworkers are mainly all men and I am one of the very few females that work. Most are in high school so they don’t work a lot, I work the most of all of them. 
There however is this one guy I work with that is cute but about 10 years older then me. I have this really bad fantasy of being on shift, especially at the end of the night when it’s just the two of us are on closing, because no one else is there. I really badly want to ask him to just bend me over and take me from behind. 

I feel like asking him to hang out as well but I’m too nervous.

What do you think I should do?

Edit: what else should I look for to see if he’s flirting back?

My dick got fucked up in an operation and its to embarrassing to show a girl... feel like i will die alone
**
When i was around 12 my dad made me get circumcised. When i was asleep the doctors said that apparently my dick hole was too low and it needed to be raised up so they did an operation on that too. I honestly don’t know what they did because my dick looks messed up its so ugly. Like theres ugly dicks then theres mine. I have never told anyone in real life about this because its too embarrassing i cant.

Ive turned down sex with girls because of this. Ive just had to make up some excuse as to why I couldn’t do it but the real reason was because its too embarrassing to show. It feels like torture, it makes me think why do I even talk to girls if I wouldn’t even be able to go all the way. Im just thinking that although it would be depressing, maybe it would be easier to just live without a partner and my own family rather than probably getting rejected if a girl was to find out.

Dad found my buttplugs
**
My parents usually respect my privacy. A few weeks ago, I decided to treat myself. I ordered a few buttplugs off of Amazon, and warned my parents that a package would be arriving Monday and they shouldn't open it. Fortunately they respected that and I had my fun with it, but last weekend I left it at my dad's house. Monday I remembered and called him.

Me: Hey dad? Can you not make my bed or anything?

Dad: I already did. 

At this point I had a small heart attack

Dad: Is everything okay? I didn't find anything.

Me: Yeah, yeah, I just thought I left something in there.

At this point I assumed I had left my plugs in my laundry or something. Apparently I was wrong. I walked up to my bedroom today, and saw my bed made...

And my lotion, lube, and buttplugs tucked behind on my shelf.

Fortunately my dad hasn't mentioned this, and I doubt he will. I just hope he doesn't find it too weird.
//
My confession...
**
I'm a blind person with near total vision loss. I absolutely hate it when people try to help me by grabbing my cane and tapping where they think I should be. It's not ok and in fact is extremely dangerous for me. I use my cane a certain way for a purpose that most people cant really understand. It's my safety net.

This leads to my confession, I sometimes tape tiny pins under the handle that is difficult for sighted people to see and the area the grab most. So when they grab my cane they prick themselves. 

The other day a poor train conductor got the sharp end and had to explain why. Instead of getting upset she said it was a surprising lesson learned and promises to tell others not to grab blind peoples canes.
//
I'm the "other man" for 2 guys who are married to each other, and they don't know it.
**
Getting this off of my chest.

I'm a single guy and a year ago, I started hooking up with a married guy I met on Growlr. There's no relationship between us other than when he's horny he sends me a message and I go, have a little fun, and I come straight home. It's purely physical and I'm happy for it to stay that way.

About a month ago, I got a message from a random guy on Grindr to come over for a little fun. Followed his directions, and it took me straight to the married guys house. It was his husband. I thought "fuck it, why not?" I'd been with this guys husband plenty of times, I'll see what this guy was like. It was fun. A lot of fun. And again, it's purely physical and I'm very happy to keep it that way.

So for the last month, I've been hooking up with both guys who are married to each other, and they don't know it. I know I'm a dick for hooking up with married men, and for knowing that they're both cheating on each other and they've no idea, but I have no intention of saying it to either of them because I don't want it to stop.
//
I'm excited for my husband to be gone this weekend.
**
My husband is going out of town this weekend and I'm really excited to have the house to myself. Nothing against my husband because I do love him and we have a good marriage, I'm just looking forward to some alone time. I'm going give myself a mani/pedi, do a face mask, binge watch some 80s horror movies (not really his thing), game online with friends, and eat veggie chicken nuggets and mac n cheese like they're being discontinued.

We've been going through a lot lately and have been investing a lot of time, energy, and work into our marriage, so it's going to be nice to do the same for myself for a weekend.

I cheated on an internet flash game to win free driving lessons
**
This was around 8 years ago when I was ready to begin taking driving lessons. On the website on a nearby driving school they had a competition going. It was one of those platform games where the only thing you do is to run forward and press one button to jump over obstacles. The top five highest scoring players by the end of the month won 5 driving lessons each, worth around $300.

Because this was a flash game, it could be modified with Cheat Engine. I didn't have much experience with cheat engine before but since I had tried it on Runescape(and failed lol) I figured I could give it a go.

You couldn't change the scoring or any of that stuff because that was being calculated by the server, you could only modify the game itself. So I set the gravity=0 and all I had to do was to jump over the first obstacle and wait a few hours while the character flied over everything and crushed the leader board.

Also used this for two friends for that extra con.

They secretly hate me for loosing weight
**
I feel a lot of people around me since I lost weight hate  me for succeeding at being thin and healthy.

This is half of the conversation I have on daily basis...


****You have lost weight but statistically you will always gain it back


**** so you have cancer now or what? 


***you look better chubby


I honestly never share with others how happy I feel with myself and the pride of accomplishing something I though impossible

 ....that was a huge challenge for me.

I will silently continue to feel happy nonetheless 😊

Edit: 
wow I never expected this much support from all of you. Its honestly humbling.  
Thank you all for the support and words of encouragement. I'm lost for words to express my gratitude to all of you. I thank you. 

I never knew that I actually care what others thought of me until this moment.... its a nice warm feeling....

i might have just fucked up my life
**
Im a 15 year old with an abusive father, Today at school I had a mental breakdown and explained to the counselor I had wanted to self harm last night, She sent me and my mother to see a doctor and when I told him that my father had hit me he said that chargers were being pressed and he is not allowed to be in the same house as us anymore. Now, we need to figure out who im living with since I cant stay with my older sister. I feel like shit and I feel like I should’ve never confessed because no my mom is in pain and we’re all just fucked and its all because of me

edit: I just woke up and wow i really didnt expect people to care that much, Thank you all for your support. We dont have any updates on the situation yet but i’ll be sure to update you all once we do, Thank you :)

I'm the scary guy who is out late at night
**
Have you ever been out late at night and seen a 6ft tall dude walking menacingly? Yeah that's me. I have really bad anxiety so I only do my cardio late at night, usually past 11p. There's something about the freedom of night time. There's usually no one else walking, it's super peaceful and places like public parks have an insanely nice vibe. The problem is on the rare chance I see someone else, they usually freak out and start going the opposite way. One time I was walking at 2am and there was a granny on her front porch. She literally yelped and ran inside her house when she saw me. That kind of hurt. The thing is, I'm as scared as they are. I keep a pocket knife on me in case I get mugged, I try to stay in well lit areas and whenever I see someone I will go a different route to avoid them. I guess that's my confession, sorry for everyone I've scared!

I think I broke my cock this morning (36M)
**
We kinda have a hobo set up here. We built these condos and we're staying in one. Because we're waiting on the CO, and the fact covid hit we haven't gone out to buy furniture. 

I always wake up with morning wood. Long story short blow up bed has holes and deflates every night. I always wake up humping something. It's involuntary but I stop when I come to. Well this morning it was the hard floor. I was half asleep humping, felt an excrutiangly painful *pop* in my dick mid shaft and it has hurt about like a broken toe since.

Guess it's time to go to the ER and play a game called "let's try to not catch covid".

I'm in too much pain to be embarrassed. As I type this now I feel unrelenting blood curdling pain all through my fucking dick radiating through my pelvis like some bricked shit took a wrong turn. Haven't taken a piss yet as I'm afraid of blowing a gasket. Fuck.

My Son Is 27 and He Acts Like a Teenager
**
I’m serious. Nothing he does is even close to age appropriate. He has never lived alone in his life, his girlfriend is 18 (they’re both undergrads), he thinks shouting racial slurs on Halo Infinite is just the most hilarious thing in the world, and he thinks making shitty Lets Plays on Youtube is gonna blow up and make him rich, and gets in trouble legally for doing reckless shit (like setting off illegal fireworks in the backyard-what if a neighbor called the cops-or he blew up the house). 

I guess I’m confessing that I’m a shitty father. As a professor, I have criticized this kind of thing in society all the time. The infantilization of young adults. I get that there isn’t a set way a 27 year old needs to act but geez, at least do something practical to be self sufficient. And I argue with my wife about this all the time. I feel like a hypocrite sometimes.
//
I was in 1st grade.
**
I was a quiet kid with my fair share of friends, but this one kid (I'll call him Z) just didn't like me. One day, Z came in with a party size bag of cotton candy to share with the class. Everyone lined up to taste some of the candy, myself included. Alas the time came, and I was next in line to eat some of the sugary goodness, and Z refused to give me. He then continued giving to the rest of the class until I was the only one who didn't get. He gave some friends seconds while I didn't even get one bite. When Z had finished allocating some cotton candy (around half remained), he put the bag into his cubby. When recess came, everyone went outside, but I told my teacher I wanted to get something from my coat. She led the class outside and I was the only one left in the class. My time had come. I went to Z's cubby and finished his cotton candy. When the school day was over, Z went to his cubby to get his things and saw an empty bag of cotton candy. To this day, I still remember the tears on Z's face, and smirk at the memory.

I liked reddit better when it wasn't flooded with edgy 13 year olds.
**
Ok boomer me all you want. It ain't my generation and it wouldn't affect me if it was, but reddits gone steadily down hill the last couple years.


Edit: I work nights, so posted and fell asleep. Yeah... I'm not going through all your responses. Some people agree, some think I should shut up. I'm just saying reddit is steadily going the way of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and any other social media platform that takes off. Like all of those they get over saturated and start to lose what appealed to me in the beginning. Don't get me wrong reddits still the best but it's definitely jumped the proverbial shark

Edit: my wife finds it hilarious that my top post is me complaining like an old man. I'm in my 30s, I'm officially old.

Edit: to the people repeating the same thing; I now understand that some people feel this isn't really confessiony, and more opiniony. Please excuse me. I'm old

I just ran two miles straight without stopping!
**
That’s all, I haven’t ever done it before and I’m trying to be healthier so I’m really proud of myself. It’s really motivating me to run more!




Edit: thanks to everyone who linked more accurate subs for this type of post. I was expecting like 4 people to see this and didn’t know the other ones existed... I still deem this a confession since no one I know knows I’m trying to get fit. I’m kind of secretly training to run 10 miles comfortably; but it’s not a juicy confession about a wrong doing so I understand how it doesn’t fit in this sub! I also really appreciate all the motivation from you kind strangers, I’m super excited to keep going and reach my goal of a healthier lifestyle!

I retired from my job quietly 2 months ago and haven't told my family.
**
Took my pension because the stress of working in Healthcare for 38 years was overwhelming.  I was afraid of getting fired and losing my pension,  so I took it early.  I figured getting some was better than getting none.
Since my family is unsupportive, I haven't told them yet.  I don't want to hear why this may not have been a brilliant idea.
On the flip side, I have come off of 4 different medications!!!  Cymbalta,  Buspar, Ativan and Ambien.  My stress level is low.  My sleep is improving.  I have time to eat healthier.  I look 10 years younger. I started yoga.
Obviously,  I don't live with them and my work status is none of their business. 
That's my juicy secret.

My wife gets away with being selfish, and it hurts.
**
My wife knows I would do anything for her, and sometimes I feel she uses that love against me.She wants to go out with the girls - I mind the kids.  She wants to skip her share of the chores, I'm cool with it.But when I'm feeling lazy or want some time with the lads, I'm a bad father who would rather spend time with them than the kids....

On top of that, she's more than happy to attend whatever remote events her most distant family member organises, but when I ask her to come watch a game with me?  she says no and I just roll with it.

She tells me she wants to have her own space, but still bothers me with whatever she wants, because she knows she'll get it.

I feel like I nothing left, can't leave her because I love her, and I suffer for it. At least the kids and the dog still love me, but I'm worried the boys will catch on treat me the same when they get older....

Not looking for advice, just wanted to get this off my chest.

My mothers vibrator.
**
Throwaway account because I would literally kill myself if this got out as to it being me. Anyways, I grew up being a poor kid so I didn't really have alot of toys, and I was also pretty young when this happened (maybe 8 or 9) I can't really remember. My mother kept our television in her room, so when we wanted to watch the television we had to go into her room. Spongebob was on that day, and I excitedly go to watch it. Being a kid with a short attention span, whenever  advertisements came on I would search the drawers of her dresser beside her bed. 

So the ad came on and I found my moms vibrator. I'm 8, so obviously I don't know what it was and I started playing with it. I found the button and I found out that it vibrated. What does a kid do? I put it in my mouth. 

I realized quite a bit later that it was a vibrator and it definitely isn't my family memory as a kid.
//
I’m getting married tomorrow and I’m so freaking nervous
**
We had to cancel our wedding that was planned for May. We waited and replanned the whole thing to take place at my parents house with a very small group on 7/23. The good news is I’ve stopped caring about anything accept being married by the end of the day. 

Our families are meeting later today. It’s 5am my time, I’m the only one awake. I’m so nervous. I can’t believe it’s finally happening. Everything is in place, I have all the necessary items. 

But in all honestly, I don’t think I was built to be a bride. I hate getting my picture taken, and I’m not comfortable being the center of attention. I don’t like everyone doing things for me, I like being the helper. 

But it’s all worth it, because I can’t wait to be his wife.

My kids are home after a 2 month stay at their grandparents and I am struggling to be a parent again.
**
I feel horrifically guilty for this but I have to get it off my chest because I’m having a panic attack. 

I worked at a grocery store and due to current circumstances, I didn’t want to risk my kids health so they stayed with their grandparents where they were safer. This went on for two months while I worked and came to a place where I was able to quit my job and have them home safely. 

This morning is the first morning of distance learning. There is a pile sky high of dirty dishes in the sink. Beanie boos are littering the floor in every room and I am frozen with panic that I’m over my head with the simple task of being a mother. I feel pathetic. I was a single mom to three, for years, how am I struggling now? 

I just needed a space to vent.  Thank you so much.

Does anyone else want to die after they orgasm
**
I get intense post nut clarity....But I’m a girl and I can’t nut. Basically I get really horny, fap it to some porn but after i orgasm I genuinely feel so dirty and want to die. Like in the moment the porn is so hot but after I orgasm I’m disgusted in myself for watching it... Like I watch some weird ass shit, I’m talking about cock and ball torture type shit...Sadism and stuff like that. Like i feel so grossed out and actually want to die after watching the porn I watch immediately after I’m finished...In real life I don’t have these kinks..but I only get horny from weird kink porn and after I orgasm I want to die :(

I’m a nurse in a nursing home. I always look the other way when I see alcohol/weed * in patients rooms
**
Tonight I was working and noticed a few vape cartridges in my patients drawer. I’m 1000% percent positive they were weed since prior to becoming a nurse I smoked a shit ton of weed. I just looked the other way. The patient was in their early 50s and bed bound, I would want to be high in their shoes too. 

Same whenever I see beers. I noticed a family sneak a beer into a hospice patients room. I don’t give a fuck. Drink up while you can. The only time I ever interfere with alcohol is when they are on meds that aren’t safely compatible with alcohol or they tend to get drunk and start disturbing other patients. Other than that, I don’t care. Do you. 

These occurrences have happened a lot. I don’t understand why nursing homes have policies against this anyways as long as it’s done safely.
//
I am intersexed
**
First, no I will not share pictures.

No one but my parents, my doctors, and my first lover know that I am not simply female. I present female with no doubt, but I have two sets of genitalia. I was born with a penis. My testicles are inside my body. I have a vagina and uterus but no ovaries.

I haven't told many people in my life for fear of rejection. Usually when a child is born like me, they do surgery to remove one set. My parents refused so here I am.

Edit: for the love of God, people, stop asking me which do i pee from. No one pees from a vagina. My urethra is in my penis so I pee from it. A normally formed woman has a urethra between her clit and vaginal opening, between her vulva.

Edit 2: because none of the people with their lizard brains active can look through the questions and answers posted already, let me make it easier for you.

No, I cannot penetrate myself.

I get a huge kick out of paying for people's stuff when they can't.
**
Yesterday, a young guy ahead of me in the grocery store had about 92 sek worth of groceries and he'd forgot his card. I broke out my card and paid for his stuff, even over his objections. He wanted to pay me back, but I just told him not to worry about it, just do something nice for someone in the future. A few years ago, my wife and I were at Costco and the young couple ahead of us were trying to use EBT to pay for their groceries, but Costco didn't take EBT, so my wife and I offered to pay for their entire order. It was almost $400. I didn't hesitate, and it felt so good to be able to do that. We're not a wealthy family, but we are better off than some, and it just seems insane to not help people in those moments, especially considering that I know full well how embarrassing it is to rock up to the grocery store clerk and not have the money to pay for things. I've had a few more experiences like that, and I actively hope for more, just for the serotonin hit I get from helping people.
//
I figured out yesterday that my son isn't biologically mine. My wife doesn't know that I know.
**
My son is almost a year old now. He doesn't look anything like me and people have always teased me about it but I couldn't get the nagging idea he might not be mine out of my head. So I got our DNA compared behind my wife's back and he's definitely not biologically mine. I found out yesterday and honestly I'm crushed. Not only did my wife cheat on me with another man but she likely knows our son isn't biologically mine or at the very least suspects it. I've already contacted an attorney who's going to take this and work on assisting me through a divorce. I see a lot of late nights drinking alone in my future even after this nightmare is over.

I quit social media 3 days ago and nobody has reached out to talk to me, yet I’ve never felt better
**
Once I made the jump from social media, I wholly expected the majority of people to stop talking to me and then a couple still would. However, nobody has reached out in 3 days but I’ve never felt better. It really helped me realize that I was putting my eggs in the wrong basket and focusing on trying to form friendships with people that didn’t want them in return. I really look back and can see the time I wasted on those people, however I’m glad I can do that now so I can look forward and see what’s really important and look for real friends whose lives aren’t centered around social media and trying to get likes or snapchats or retweets or whatever else. I have truly never been happier and I can’t wait to see what the future holds

Edit: I have reached out to people I wanted to stay in contact with and they all left me on read, thus proving the friendship wasn’t really there to begin with. Also, I know reddit is a social media but it is different from others in the way that it is run
//
When people are mean or rude to me I go online and leave compliments or nice comments for strangers.
**
Basically my family is so toxic. I used to work with toxic people who made fun of me.

Whenever a toxic person at work bullied me I would go online and make a donation to sea shepherd in order to channel something negative into a positive. 

Today I’ve been excluded from my brothers birthday celebrations and my mother hasn’t spoken to me since I got married a few weeks ago. I just left a bunch of positive comments for people on IG and I would normally do this on Facebook too. I tell older women how beautiful they are.

I don’t do it for recognition. Just to make someone smile. If I can turn my pain into joy then that’s the purpose.

I’m going to take my dog for a drive in a little while and enjoy life.

I cried over porn once
**
The usual night time thing, getting ready to rub one out and fall asleep. Decided to watch search up some passionate homemade porn, saw one that said something along the lines of "slow sunday with my love" they looked so in love. Constantly reassuring each other and showering each other with kisses and sweet nothings all while having sex. I forgot about rubbing one out and watched them because I was more invested in how sweet they were to each other. At the end they just kissed and they were just hugging each other. Cuddling, aftercare. That's what broke me, I don't know why but something about that video was just so fucking beautiful and I was jealous. I nearly feel like a pussy for sharing this but yeah. I cried over porn.

edit: holy shit this got some attention! Im gonna answer some shit that people been asking

1. All I remember is that it was on XVIDEOS, I was looking for that shit everywhere. this was back in 2018 or something. 
2. im mentally ill
3. No I haven't found it yet.

My dads friend wants to fuck me
**
18f so this random guy had been texting me on facebook like 3 or 4 years ago, when I was around 15, talking sexual wanting to have a dom/sub relationship, and I was a slut back then so like obviously texted back, not knowing or caring who it really could be. It never got serious like all I did was send nudes an he’d say dirty shit. Well today, he hits me up an we started talking and he says “I've known you for a while. We've been face to face on several occasions and I've been to your old house multiple times baby girl.” That shit makes me freeze and I feel sick and dizzy like who the fuck have I been talking to. Wondering who it could be, a crazy stalker or sum shit, then he says “You are 18 now but it would be a delicate situation with your dad.”   So obviously, it seems to be one of my dads friends. I am 18 now but this guy groomed me this whole time an was in my house and has prolly had normal small talk with me in front of my family. Dont know how to feel lmk what you would do
Also I’m visibly attractive, always wore slutty clothes. Is it my fault?

My methhead friend who was nearly homeless when I joined is now making close to 6 figures lives in a penthouse in the center of town and I’m absolutely seething with envy even though I’m happy for him for making it.
**
He got a stripper GF and they make onlyfans and have bottles of wine and champagne that cost more than I make in two weeks. He lives in the center of town in a high rise penthouse that is 3k a month and he is living his best life while still smoking meth and doing nothing.

I busted my ass working in the military and barely have a few grand in savings and said it was worth it because I’m “in a better position than my friends back home” that illusion has been shattered and I can’t help but feel this deep feeling of “you don’t deserve this” even though I wish the absolute best for him.  This is a weird bittersweet moment in life.

I'm a graphic designer, not a web developer, and my boss kept asking me to make us a website so I did.
**
I have very limited knowledge of html and css. I maintain our main website in WordPress but she wanted a whole new website for one of our products. It didn't make much sense but I started working on it anyway. I started with a template and edited that to match our theme and I wanted them to give me the text to use. That would have been the end of it. But no, they wanting to add changes and move stuff around. I don't know how to do that. So I finally lost it today after being asked for like the 10th time, "Is this done yet?". I took an 8 page product guide, converted that into an image, and used that image as the entire home page of the website. My boss has a business degree and she doesn't know how these things work so she'll probably say "Thx u!".

About to let her know I'm done.

I'm male and I was raped when I was 5 years old
**
Ok, this is the first time I talk about this, I'm 29 years old now, this happened when I was 5 years old, my cousin(she was 14 at the time) used to make me touch her naked body, up and down, you know what I mean, but the worst part is that she and one of her females friends made me had sexual intercourse with a little girl, she was older than me, she was like 7 or 8 years old.

I can remember all the feelings, but what I can recall the most is the smell of my cousin body, I feel ashamed about what I did  with that girl, and with my cousin, but I was a kid, I was only 5 years old, and that is what I can remember, I don't know anything else.  


The worst part of this, is that she talks to me like if nothing ever happened,but I can remember everything, every single part of the story, I can remember and I feel ashamed.

please, don't judge me.

i’m pretending i’m in love with my gf, who has cancer so she can have a relationship before she dies.
**
i (20) m met J (21) f via a family friend, she always had had a obvious crush on me but i was focused on school and work to be in any relationship. back in 2019 she was diagnosed with leukemia which took our whole family/ neighborhood by shock. 3 years later and the cancer has gotten worse and at a small get to together she confessed to my cousin that her biggest regret was not being in any relationship her entire life. so back in february i took her out on a date where she said she had the best day of her life and told me she loved me, so i said i love you back and now we’ve been dating ever since. truth being told i don’t love her in a romantic way but i do love her as a person but it hurts telling her i love her everyday where deep down in my heart i don’t mean it.

Just turned 20 and celebrated by making myself cum 20 times.
**
It's my(F) 20th bday today, my BF of 4 years is out drinking with friends, texted me tonight but didn't wished me a happy birthday. I think he completely forgot it.

At this point I think I'm just over it. Haven't had sex in 2 weeks and I hadn't have an orgasm with him in months. Something just clicked in me, so I got creative with myself and didn't stop till my 20th O. 

Now that I properly "celebrated" my Bday my mind cleared and I realized I have ignored many many signs in the last year. I'm very young and I shouldn't feel like sex is a chore.

In the morning I'm gonna break up with my boyfriend.

90 percent of this sub is bullshit.
**
And 99 percent about sex. 

Just read a story about a sexual encounter that *totally* happened for the umpteenth time. We get it, we are all horny but for the love of god stop posting this mid-ass fan fiction. 

It’s obvious you didn’t actually fuck your evil landlord’s wife. No you didn’t have a romantic rendezvous with your ex’s mother, then in the same day slip on a banana peel fall unconscious and wake up to your wife’s sister giving you head. 

I came to this sub for some juicy shit like “I accidentally poisoned my son” or “I committed a war crime” and shit that may actually be true. Put down the tablet and go fuck a woman/man/hamster/rock/whatever you are into and stop writing this cheap ass bibliographic porn. 

Respectfully, stop the cap. 




- Thank you I just had to get this off my chest.

I just discovered that my 8 year old brother watches porn
**
Today i(15,m) asked my brother(8,m) of i could search something on his phone, i open chrome, click the search bar and the keyboard suggestions on his phone were " Rule | pornhub | pornhub anal" i was shocked, and then i looked on his history, it was empty like he never used chrome, however i decided to not snitch on him, i went to his keyboard configuration and cleaned the keyboard data, so it wont appear, am i in the wrong here, or did i do the right thing? Sorry if i had broken english, im not a native english speaker

Update: installed site blockers on his devices, and hid the apps, tested them and it worked, i dont want him to go through what i went through

I, 16F am lying to my 70F grandmother and I'm glad.
**
so, typing on mobile and quickly. I apologize for mistakes.

So, today is my grandmother's birthday. Its just her and I living together, ever since my grandfather died and my mom left me here. We make do with what we have.

My grandmother was disappointed when my sister 24F forgot my grandmother's birthday again, which she has never remembered. My grandmother told me not to text my sister, because she should remember on her own, but I never listen. I texted my sister that it was my grandmother's birthday, and to come over. My sister immediately responded, and came over with flowers and gifts for my grandmother. 

My grandmother is so happy, and overjoyed that my sister remembered. So while this isn't a scandalous confession, it's a secret I'll keep from my grandmother perhaps forever because seeing her so happy for the first time in a while broke my heart.
