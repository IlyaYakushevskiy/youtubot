AITA for bringing my SIL’s wallet to the restaurant when she conveniently always forgets it?
**
Edit: update on profile

My (f28) SIL “Amy” (f26) always comes to visit from out of town. She stays with us instead of a hotel, and always wants to go to expensive restaurants. She always conveniently forgets her wallet, or domes up with some excuses as to why she can’t pay her share. She has implied that since I make much more money than her, I should be the one to pay (no, not my husband should pay, but me *specifically*). I do make a fair amount of money, but not so much that I can treat someone every time they come into town. Nonetheless, in the past, I have just paid the bill and asked her to pay me back. She never has. 

She had made a reservation at an extremely expensive restaurant last night, and before we left, I made it clear that I wouldn’t be paying her bill. 

This is where I might be the asshole, and I’ll admit I got this move straight from and episode of Two and a Half men. As we were leaving, her and my husband went to the car. I pretended I forgot something and went back inside. I found her wallet sitting right on top of her suitcase. I put it in my purse and we went to the restaurant.

When we were done eating, I asked for separate bills. She said no, we need one bill, because she “forgot” her wallet again. I reached in my purse and said, “this wallet?” 

She was extremely furious. She said that I should not have touched or grabbed her wallet. 

So AITA for taking her wallet and bringing it to the restaurant?

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Jeez lol! So many comments that I can’t keep up, but thank you to everyone who had something to say.

Edit 2: Amy just called me, she saw this post and she yelled at me for "badmouthing" her on the internet. Honestly I don't care. Amy, hopefully reading all these comments is a wake up call for you.

UPDATE: AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?
**
I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

Since I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

The funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. 

My sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. 

When Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

We went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

I’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

I haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. 

That’s it. Take care everyone.
//
AITA for making a dad joke?
**
Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good.
//
AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?
**
We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.
//
META: Too many AITA commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.
**
I’ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP’s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

When we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

Encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

Please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts.

AITA for "announcing" that my dad's not paying my college tuition
**
My aunt and uncle are paying for my cousins college.  

My dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff. Which would be fine if you have a normal dad. Mine isn't.  

My dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked "missing" because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides "to make sure I'm not hiding anything ". 

I decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay. Which I could totally see him doing.  I'd rather be in debt than controlled for 4 more years.  

I just finished my first year. 

Well my family got together on the 4th and... well sometimes they're nosey.   They were talking about my cousins school and my uncle looked at my dad and said "well how much is - my name- school costing you?" 

I said "what are you asking him for I'm the one paying for it?" 

Later on my dad was pissed off and said that it was out of line to say that and I embarrassed him. 


I didn't do it to embarrass him, I was just being honest.  He doesn't even know how much tuition is so he was the wrong person to ask.

Aita for wearing the “joke” bikini my friend got me?
**
So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend “Mandy” for me a “super cute bikini”. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

Haha good joke Mandy. 

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. 

We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my bf on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from her. 


Anyway. Aita?

AITA for storming off from my sister's wedding after she deadnamed my son?
**
I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.

My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it. 

Her wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said "where's Nia's dress?". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said "fine" and that was it.

At the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card "Nia". I went to my sister and she said she used "their real name". I told her me and the boys are leaving and she told me "don't you dare cause a scene at MY WEDDING, Nia can be a guy any other day". I called her a bigot and we left. 

My family says I ruined her wedding.

UPDATE AITA for not sharing my medical history before being pranked?

 Link to original post-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gflupe/aita\_for\_not\_sharing\_medical\_history\_before\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gflupe/aita_for_not_sharing_medical_history_before_being/) 

Heyo! I had a few folks message me over the last couple of months, the latest tonight. I touches me that so many of you still message me to see if things are going well, so I wanted to update people en masse.

Life is going phenomenally. I axed the friend group, and have since been kicking butt. I realized that if my close friend group was consistently putting me down or taking advantage of me, who else could be. The biggest answer was myself. I stopped doing things I enjoyed to invest in people that took joy in hurting me (Turns out it went so much deeper than gas lighting).

I got two new hobbies, wood working and brewing. I absolutely love them both, and have made friends in those communities. I started cooking instead of take out and I met the woman who is now my girlfriend at the local market and we do most things together now. I realized my job had been taking a huge advantage over me. I worked significantly harder and longer hours for less pay than the employees under me.

After I transitioned to taking better care of myself I successfully created a resume that outlined my successes (Recognizing those successes took quite a bit of effort!) and got a new job in higher management for significantly more pay. I'm also going to buy a house this December with a yard for my dog and I. Nothing big, just a nice one bedroom with a large yard for my buddy and I to play fetch in.

So thanks Reddit. Owe you one. Never would have made life improvement if it weren't for an external force.

AITA - Telling my parents to pay me back my college tuition if they want a relationship
**
I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. 

Because of their expectation I’d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I’m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn’t allowed to apply for college.

I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn’t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought “them” for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.

My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I’m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were “sorry if they caused me pain” but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn’t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn’t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn’t being serious and I just left. Since then, I’ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I’m being immature and hurtful. I don’t think so at all.

AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?
**
New to reddit, please bare with. 

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says "but I didn't". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd "threatened" to do it before (I literally just said "okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?
//
AITA for getting up from my chair in the middle of christmas dinner and shouting "SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY" in response to my husband's observation?
**
So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his "observations" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say "oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though..." or when he looks at my waist and says "Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.



We went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said "I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs "SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an "observation" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.



Now I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??
//
AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs?
**
I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. 

She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. 

Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize. 

So Reddit, AITA?

AITA for silently getting up and walking out of the restaurant during NYE dinner after I was told to pay for everyone at the table (my inlaws)?
**

I f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.


I noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.


For NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my " inheritance pocket" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.


He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.


He is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.

AITA for refusing to tell my husband the gender of our baby after he skipped going to the dr appointment with me?
**
My husband & I are expecting. This is our first baby and we're excited. Thing is he barely attends any dr appointments with me and his excuses aren't even valid. He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always "I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?".


Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.



He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.


He's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.




AITA?


EDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.

AITA for not telling my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting?
**
My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.

My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.

Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.

My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.

I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.

My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.

But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.

I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.

AITA for not telling him?

AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?
**
I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?

AITA For Firing An Employee After His Parents Died?
**
I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

AITA?

\*\*Update\*\*\*

Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.

AITA for getting mad my artist hid their initials in my tattoo?
**
This is a short one. Names changed for privacy. 

I went to a tattoo shop in my area, with a photo of the tattoo I wanted. It was one my dad had gotten to honor my passed grandfather who’s father also had it. But the point is - it was important to me that the tattoo looked EXACTLY as it did in the photo. 

I get to the shop, I explain everything, I pay, get the tattoo, and we’re done, I think it looks awesome, everything is great! Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She’s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, “Who’s AJ?” 

I ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I’m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it’s no big deal if I hadn’t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated. They told me the style of art I got is called traditional and it’s “pretty trad” for all artists who do that style to do it. I demanded a partial refund and they refused, so I complained to the owner who made the artist give me a full refund. 

Now the artist is running a full smear campaign, talking about moving shops, and all kinds of crap. My sister says I’m an asshole for pushing the issue, but I feel like, at the end of the day, I told you exactly what I wanted and you didn’t do that. AITA?

AITA for not saying anything about the underwear?
**
My 20 year old daughter and her fiancé are currently staying with us. I love my daughter but she is very difficult and I can’t stand her fiancé. I gave them a deadline to move out because I can’t take this anymore. 

They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife’s underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.

She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn’t realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.

My daughter burst into tears and won’t talk to me. Her fiancé said we’re fucked and left the house but my wife thought it was funny.

UPDATE: AITA for making a dad joke?

My son found the post, and shared it with my daughter. This was after apologizing to her. She cried again. 
  
So last week, we decided to have a father/daughter bonding weekend. Honestly, it was awesome. I took her bowling, to get a manicure, becoming Disney princesses(I looked awesome as Jasmine), and so forth. She loved it. I loved it. Everyone was happy. Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. “I’m starving, what do you want Maddie?” “Hi Starving, I’m not your daughter”. She had this biggest smirk on her face. She hugged me and I kissed her forehead. I’m sure she’d been planning this for weeks.

WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to "test" my loyalty?
**
My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?

Edit: I don't live in the USA. Please don't discuss legalities based on the laws there.

UPDATE: AITA for donating my deceased daughters college fund instead of giving it to my husbands daughter
**
link to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/epmdeh/aita_for_donating_my_daughters_college_fund/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


I’ve gotten messages asking for an update, so I’ll give one.

I left my husband. He told me I couldn’t do what I wanted with the college fund. I took my name off the account so my ex husband was the only owner in the case that my (soon to be ex) husband tried to claim that money in our divorce.

My daughters father and I went for a trip to my daughters favorite town, we went to her favorite spot and spread her ashes. 

I’ve been staying with my sister, and looking for apartments to move into. 

As far as the fund, we have discussed starting a scholarship, or paying a students tuition. We haven’t decided exactly what to do. 

That’s about it

AITA my classmate "saved goldfish" by releasing them into the ocean, I called her a dumbass
**
My classmate recently made a tiktok and she showed a group of people at lunch time it. They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say "hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out" and in it she explains how she "rescued" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free. 

I was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said "you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen" her friend says "well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her. 

They say that I'm a bully and walk away. I later get called into the principal's office who told me I was expected to apologize, and I said no, I stand by what I said. Fuck ignorant people who destroy the environment. My parents were called over and I got sent home and my parents are pissed I refused to apologize. I might get suspended.
//
AITA for refusing to get on a flight?
**
 My boyfriend’s parents paid for them, my boyfriend’s siblings and their SO to all go on a flight to Cabo for spring break. Becky his mom hasn’t seem to like me for some reason she always makes snide remarks about my parents blue collar jobs and my field is nursing. 

We get to the airport and Becky got 7 other people first class tickets and me 1 coach ticket.  She told me I was used to it and she had a free coach ticket so I should be grateful for going. They all did their express check ins and left me in the long line for me to think about what the heck is going on. I had to keep from crying the whole time in line. I got up to the counter and there was a baggage fee to me. My boyfriend at the time never once helped me through the coach line or said anything to his mom. I looked over at his mom’s smug face as I was about to pay the checked baggage fee. And I let all of my frustrations out on the attendant and started crying. Basically she said don’t go with that family sweetie they don’t appreciate you. Continues to cry and took my luggage and got out and got out of line with the super sweet check in woman. I was so upset on how I was treated and started crying on my boyfriend in the airport about how his mother was treating me. 

I broke up with him at the airport and his mother was so embarrassed. I told her what a bitch she was. My boyfriend has been blowing up my phone saying how could I do that to his mother and just back out of a vacation very last minute and wasted everyone’s time and money.
//
AITA for refusing to punish or allow my wife to punish our son?
**
This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.

My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.

I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.

I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to "even the score."

I told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?
//
AITA For calling my co-worker "chunky" after she repeatedly calls me "slim" and makes references to my weight after I asked her multiple times not to.
**
I have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me "slim" and I even heard her say one time "go ask toothpick" and she has said stuff like "you need some meat on your bones" & "you need to eat". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

Today when she said "morning slim" I replied "morning chunky" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is "different" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a "compliment". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's "a high school issue and we should figure it out".

EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.
//
AITA for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?
**
My friends are dating, they’re also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (I’m talking two lines or less). I say this not to be a hater, I truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. Neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they’ve got under 1500 followers combined). 

Anyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other’s shoulders. Very platonic. 

Anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don’t want “the public” to know they are dating. I would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don’t. Also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

Anyway I asked what they meant, and they said they didn’t want to end up in gossip rags....

I pointed out that they are not famous and that they don’t even have functioning IMDb pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

I think they’re delusional but they’ve been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). At this point, I don’t even want to be their friend. However, and probably because I’m an asshole, I don’t want to delete it based solely on principle.

Edit: okay, so many of y’all are right. I suppose I should separate how I feel about their (ridiculous/delusional/stupid) reasoning with the fact that no one should have an image of themselves online that they don’t want made public. I’ll take it down.
//
AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family
**
I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I've given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.


Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.


I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I've spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts.
//
AITA for not telling my wife that I picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?
**
I'm going to try to keep this short and simple. I always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before, I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We're only human and it's a part of life.

Last weekend I got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. She was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

I haven't told my wife about it, because I don't want to violate the deal I made with her. I want her to know that she can trust me. I just hope I'm making the right choice.
//
AITA for throwing my sister out of my house after she billed me?
**
My sister is a trainwreck. She needed a place to stay and I have a large enough home for an extra person. She has no job or income. I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash.

I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other "work" for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.

Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. 

I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.

So I threw her out. 

The money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income. I was disgusted how she came at me.
//
AITA for being visibly shocked/dumbfounded that my GF (21, American) could not point out Florida on a map?
**
While sitting next to my girlfriend on a plane I was bored as fuck and looking at the maps are that are found in the back of the airline magazines. A conversation led to her revealing that she did not know where Florida was on the map. Keep in mind she had graduated a private high school and is currently going into her senior year of college. Conversation progressed further into me finding out she could not point out AUSTRALIA either. I was visibly astonished at this revelation and essentially said "...are you kidding." She immediately got defensive calling me an asshole for making her feel stupid. I do feel bad for making her feel stupid, although I feel as if my reaction to her not being educated on such elementary shit was warranted and may even be a wake up call for her to learn some basic geography... AITA?
//
AITA for not wanting my son to literally be named "John Doe?"
**
So my last name is Doe. It hasn't affected my life much apart from occasionally being called "Dodo" while growing up or friends spelling it "D'Oh" as a joke, and I'm generally pretty neutral about it.

My wife is six months pregnant and wants to name our future son after her grandfather, who died of cancer in September. His name was John. 

I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe "John Doe" is his real name. 

My wife thinks I'm being an asshole for vetoing a name with a strong family connection and says I'm exaggerating the issues he would face. AITA?
//
AITA for not giving up my second "free" seat next to me in the plane?
**
I am obese. Like I am comfortable having two seats in the plane type of obese. I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. 

A week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. 

So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like "Fucking fat bitch" under her breath but nothing directly to me. 

So Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?
//
AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?
**
Hi all. 

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. 

Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?
//
AITA for not paying to change my father's gravely insulting gravestone?
**
My father and mother had a very bitter marriage towards the end of his life, he had a long running affair with another married co-worker and got her pregnant before he passed. He was planning to leave mom, skip the country and move to Canada to start a new life with her. They had a house picked out and all. 

He had moved out and was living with his co-worker when he suddenly died of a heart attack while having sex. Divorce papers were never filed, no legal separation. They were in the process of moving all things legal. But on paper, they were still happily married. 

Now me and my siblings are already out of home, our youngest sibling is 19 and is in college. I work for a tech company and I'm currently back in my hometown helping my mom manage his estate. 

Well, my mom was hurt and petty and marked his gravestone as "In loving memory of John Doe, son, husband, father and adulterer."

My dad's family and his pregnant partner are mad and want me to fix it. 

I personally think its fine, that's who he was. He was all of those things. And since it's my mom's plot, I can't do anything.

I’ve gotten a few messages asking to update, which I’m sad to say will be very boring. 

We broke up like 2 weeks after the post. He didn’t like that I posted about it on Reddit, therefore he said he definitely wasn’t going to buy me a new ring and that if this was how I was going to be, then he didn’t want to marry me, a bridezilla. 

I pretty much told him cool, get out of my house. That was about a month ago and he has a new girlfriend, who will probably get the same hand-me-down, ugly ass ring he already gave to 2 other girls. 

There we go. Book closed.

AITA for kicking out my girlfriend
**
So I have a cat named Raven who's 3 years old.

My girlfriend of 2 years moved in with me a few weeks ago and it was clear she didn't like my cat.

I didn't think it was really a big deal until one day I got home and he was just gone. He's not an outdoor cat and he never goes outside. 

He was gone for hours and I was worried sick until my buddy came to my house and returned him, saying he found him 2 blocks from my house.

I asked my girlfriend how my cat, who has never tried to go out before ended up that far from my house and she admitted to kicking him out.

I was furious, saying she had no right to kick him out and told her that since she thought she had the power to kick my cat out, I wanted her out of my house by the end of the month.

She cried that she had nowhere to go and that she would have to live on the streets. I said I didn't care and told her to leave by the end of the month.

My friends think I'm being too harsh, but my cat could have died because of her and I don't want her trying anything else.

AITA for demanding the same Christmas present my stepbrother got?

I sound like a real asshole but I've completely lost my mind over this.

I'm 17 and my stepbrother is 17. We both have our driving license.

I just found out 5 days ago that my dad and stepmom bought a used car for my stepbrother. They got me a 600 dollar gift card to best buy. 

I know $600 is a lot of money but what the fuck? Am I crazy or is it super unfair? It's literally the straw that broke the goddamn camel's back.

I'm actually so pissed off that I've moved to my mom's house full time.

My dad seems to be genuinely sorry and told me he's looking for a car now but that it'll take a while.

I messaged him back saying that I'll decide if I want to see him after he decides to be fair for once. I've ignored all other calls and messages from him since.

My stepbrother messaged me saying that I need to chill out and that he'll let me use his car. He also said that I need to stop bitching and ruining everyone's Christmas. I told him to get in his civic and fuck off.

Update: AITA for not making coffee how my fiance wants me to
**
[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nhzub1/aita_for_not_making_coffee_how_my_fiance_wants_me/)

So it's been about a year since I made this post. Whenever I read posts like mine on here, I'm always wondering, did OP leave that asshole, so for those of you who care, I left that asshole.

A lot of you were on the nose that this wasn't the only way that he was controlling. My ex believes that he's the smartest person in the room, so if you're doing something differently than how he would, then you're doing it wrong and must be corrected.

I'm not saying that everyone's responses to my post gave me a revelation and I immediately knew what I had to do, but it was a nail in the coffin.

I'm living within an hour of my parents now when before I was on the opposite side of the country. I have a job as a caregiver and am planning to go to grad school to be a social worker. I have a boyfriend who doesn't try to control every aspect of my life. When I go grocery shopping, I'm not stressing about accidentally buying the wrong brand of pasta (which was the right brand of pasta when we lived in a different state, I still don't get that) or juice that's from concentrate. And I've switched to pre-ground coffee because fuck you, I want to. None of this would've happened if I'd stayed with him.

So yeah, thank you to everyone who played a tiny role in helping me see what an unhealthy relationship I was in.

AITA for honking at another driver who cut in front of me at a drive thru each time she tries to order
**
This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of me and like 8 others behind me. I laid on the horn and tried to block her from cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off. 

Okay. I’m the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off. We then ordered and went about our day. 

I just can’t people who are extremely rude like that lady and I couldn’t simply let this go. 

AITA for this?

AITA for deleting my son's Minecraft world?
**
I have 2 children, a 9 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me.

Since school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.

So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again. He has been crying and sobbing throughout the day, and has refused to eat any of his meals.
//
AITA for going to the police over a 'prank'
**
Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down "are these vegan?" To which my friends replied "yeah, they're sunfed" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling "the CHICKENS!!!"). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.
//
AITA for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner
**
Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like "Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop" and "Awowo-fwatata", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


"Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?"


Seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. I rolled my eyes and told her:


"I am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. Please excuse me." 


Then I left the restaurant without her. I don't know what occurred to me but I probably shouldn't have done that, but I guess it kinda just snapped. AITA?

AITA for I telling my childhood bully (who is MtF transgender) that she will always be the “boy who bullied me”?
**
When I was a in middle school, I was viciously bullied by this boy, who I’ll call Z. He spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

It’s been 12 years, and Z has since come out as MtF transgender. She messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. We went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. It was along the lines of, “I’m sorry for being mean. I was young, and I was struggling with my gender identity.”

I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, “Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won’t change that.” She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out. 

AITA?

AITA for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her?
**
I know the title sounds absolutely terrible. 
 
My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since "I've been trying to hard to please myself from men". We broke up.
 
The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it.
 
But alas, AITA?
 
No. I did not cheat on her.
 
Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after.
//
AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?
**
My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

&#x200B;

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?
//
AITA for replacing myself with my twin brother at my in-laws’ Christmas Eve party to see if anyone noticed?
**
I am 31, and have an identical twin brother. For a while I’ve told my wife that none of her family members notice me or care about anything I do on Christmas Eve but they insist on me attending. She told me that’s not true, they genuinely like me and enjoy talking to me. But I know that the only times they’ve included me I had to basically insert myself into conversations and it feels awkward and unnatural. 

So I had a wager with my wife. Bring my twin brother Steve instead of me, and see if anyone notices. I purposefully did not prep Steve on anything, he went in completely clueless (he knew why we were doing it and was game. I gave him $20.)  

As I suspected, Steve confirmed that he wasn’t approached all night, nobody could tell he wasn’t me, and he admitted he even felt excluded and he could only imagine how I felt. 

So this morning on Christmas I invited Steve to join (normally he’s with my mom and dad every year as he’s not married or in a relationship.) they know about him obviously but didn’t know about the switcheroo. That was when I revealed that last night “I” was Steve and expressed disappointment that nobody noticed and said this is why I stopped trying, nobody talks to me. 

My wife drew the line here, she was hoping we would keep this between the two of us as a funny prank. But how can I expect her family to see what jerks they’ve been if I don’t expose it? FWIW Steve was fine.
//
AITA for losing weight before my sister's wedding?
**
I 28F used to be quite overweight, over the last year or so I have made many changes in my life and have successfully lost almost 100lbs. I don't live close to any of my family and don't post on social media so my family wasn't really aware of my weight loss. I did mention that I was making healthier choices but that's it. It's just that every time before that I've tried to lose weight it hasn't worked out so I didn't want anyone commenting on it.

My sister 26F got engaged last year and I'm super happy for her. Due to circumstances, the wedding had to be pushed back a little. It's happening a week from now and because I haven't seen everyone in so long I decided to come down two weeks earlier to help out and catch up. Well, when I came to see my family my sister freaked out upon seeing me. As it turns out she has gained a bit of weight not super noticeable to me she still looks great. But I think this is the first time in our lives that I'm smaller than her I've always been the "fat sister". She basically accused me of trying to upstage her and my parents are fully taking her side. I'm really not sure if I'm in the wrong here as so many of my family are taking her side of things.

AITA for pressing charges against my son?
**
My son (28) was visiting us for a couple days and was at my house alone babysitting my daughters kid.

According to my son, the other day my 4-year-old granddaughter (his niece) pulled down the TV and broke it. My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.

My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.

Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. 

I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?

Update to AITA for not tell my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he is expecting?
**
Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dgfkt3/aita_for_not_telling_my_dad_he_isnt_getting_the

A lot of people have asked me for updates so I thought id make one.

It was kind of positive?

I agreed with many comments in my first post where they said my grandparents were setting me up for drama.

I talked to my grandparents and shared these concerns. They were understanding and setup a family meeting with them, their lawyer, my dad, his wife, and myself.

I was secretly hoping that my grandparents would get over some of their issues with my dad and his wife but nope. My dad's wife actually started crying and wailing when they revealed that I would be getting most of the inheritance. I could see my grandmother almost exploding. My dad to his credit, looked disappointed but said it was their money to do as they wished.

The new agreement is that my father will receive $75k, and each of my younger siblings will receive a 50K education fund.

My dad's wife did call me a few days later and acted really foolishly. And she somehow thought that insulting my mother would help her.

I told her that if she ever said something bad about my mother again I would tell my grandparents about it. That seems to have shut her up.

My relationship with my dad was never the greatest. But I haven't really seen any further decline in the relationship.

But I feel a lot of relief now. Thanks everyone!
//
UPDATE AITA for taking a 3 hour nap every day and expecting my husband to look after the kids and only wake me up for emergencies?
**
It's been a while since I last posted but a lot has happened so I figured I should update you. 

Making this post has been an eye opener for me and I decided there and then that I was done. So thanks to everyone who told me what I desperately needed to hear. 

I started gathering evidence which would allow me to leave relatively savely. After I had enough evidence I prepared to leave. I gathered all documents and secretly packed up some stuff for the kids and myself. I informed my parents and my brother about the situation. My parents immediately turned my brother's old room into the new kids room and my old room has never stopped being mine. I waited for my husband to be gone and then my brother picked us all up. 

I left a message for my husband explaining that I wasn't coming back and that I'd be filing for divorce. I also told him about all the evidence so he wouldn't do anything stupid. 

I've been at my parents' for nearly a week now. We have a carer who stays here 3 nights a week and I share the other 4 nights with both my parents. My dad is retired so he looks after the kids for a good portion of the day. 

I have talked to a lawyer and she said I will likely get full custody. 
My soon to be ex has left some nasty messages but hasn't shown up so I feel relatively safe. I don't think he will fight for custody since he was always disappointed that our daughter wasn't a son and our son isn't the strong little boy that he wanted either. 

As of now I will stay with my parents. The kids are happy, my parents are happy and I had 7 hours of sleep last night.
//
AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team?
**

I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. 

Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. 

I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. 

Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing.
//
AITA for "forcing" my boyfriend to do the dishes?
**
I’m lactose intolerant. Every time I make tacos, my boyfriend always makes jokes about how I’m “disrespecting Mexican culture” by not having cheese in my tacos. I’ve told him multiple times I’m not going to give myself the shits just to make him feel better about my friggin’ tacos (he's not even Mexican, he's white.).

This came to a head last night when we were having tacos again. I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there’s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.

I told my boyfriend he was a raging douchecanoe and went to bed, leaving him to do the cleanup. I still haven’t spoken to him all morning, and he’s complaining about how I "forced" him to do the dishes, because normally I do them. AITA here?
//
AITA for returning home after I found out that my husband booked 1st class for him and his friend while I got economy?
**


My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled "I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was "royalty" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I "technically" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

He (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.
//
AITA for choosing my brother over my marriage?
**
My parents divorced when I was 3, and went into separate marriages. I had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. When I was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. I had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

Five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. My mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. My father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. Obviously my family is morning, and I've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

The only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and I'm not going to let that happen. I told my wife that I was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. She did not take it well and is furious that I would choose my brother over her. I doubt my marriage will survive, but I can't let my brother go into foster care.

//
AITA for not wanting coal for Christmas?
**
This year I went to my fiancé’s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family’s house instead. 

I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fiancé “Dan” related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for “Dan’s” parents based off of things I’d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan’s other relatives (I didn’t know them that well). 

I wasn’t expecting many gifts from Dan’s relative’s because I didn’t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. 

At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. 

I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it’s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don’t have to stress over finding a gift, and it’s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. 

I told Dan I couldn’t believe I skipped my own family’s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?
//
AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?
**
Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of "what the fuck is your problem"-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her "Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.
//
AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?
**
I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them "you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense." But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a "warning spit" (just saliva) and they went "eww" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.
//
AITA for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents?
**
I got married on Saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. 

So the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. 

My parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. Obviously there's no way I could have known this.

I'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15 minutes so they could be there. AITA?
//
AITA for regifting my kids their own tablets for Christmas?
**
My kids, 6&7, each had an iPad mini.  Over the summer they were having a rough time, constantly fighting with each other and just being brats in general. I lost it one day and took their iPads away, saying they were being sold, never to be seen again.  Tears were shed. The iPads were cleaned up, put back into their original boxes, accessories packed away, ready for sale...but I couldn’t do it. They went into a box in the closet. 
Summer passed, fall passed. The kids have been great and I feel they’ve earned them back. 

Christmas is coming. Money is super tight this year. AITA for wanting to clear the iPads with a factory reset, buy a couple new cases as a distraction and regift them their old iPads as new ones?
//
AITA for suing my ex?
**
So I dated a YouTuber.

We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority.

Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up.

Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.

Was I the asshole?
//
AITA for showing my twin sister’s onlyfans to our parents?
**
I (18 f) and my identical twin sister (also 18 f, obviously) have always had a tumultuous and competitive relationship. We’ve always fought over everything; guys, clothes, friends, etc. but our relationship came to a halt a few weeks ago when a mutual guy friend of ours sent me a link to an onlyfans profile, with an attached message that stated “this u?” 

Confused, I clicked on the link and was shocked to discover that the profile belonged to my twin sister. The profile picture was very clearly a scantily clad image of her, and the username was my nickname that literally everyone in my life uses. I asked our friend about it and he told me that he had discovered the profile through twitter and then subscribed to the profile, which included dozens of videos of her doing… spicy things to say the least, solo and with partners, all of which with her face showing.

I was floored and, in a fit of rage, showed the profile to our parents. I mean… literally anyone who saw that profile that knows us would immediately assume that it’s me considering she’s basically going by my name. Our parents forced her to delete the profile and she hasn’t spoken to me since, claiming that I not only ruined her main source of income, but also betrayed her trust. However, I think that she betrayed my trust by going by my nickname. AITA?

Aita for only going to black salons
**
Hi there, this is my first post and this is a throw away. I am a 30 year old white woman with thick curly brown hair (3c if you know what that means).  I have always struggled with my hair and was adopted into a family of people with straight hair who couldnt care for my hair properly leading to huge knots and regularly get my hair massacred by scissors to make it short to be easier to deal with.

When i went to uni i met my best friend who is black and has a similar hair type to me and when noticing my struggle helped me out. She showed me hair products from brands intended for black people that really helped with my hair quality and even took me to the salon she went to that catered for black hair types. My hair has been amazing ever since, theyve been the only people to understand how to care for my hair and make it look nice. 

Well onto the actual argument, me and some friends from work went out for dinner and we were talking about our hair and i commented that i go to a salon that specialises in black haircare. One of the women ( also white) commented that it was inappropriate for me as a white woman to take advantage of black products and services that should only be used by black people. When i asked why she said that its kind of cultural appropriation. The others there agreed with her and i felt uncomfortable ever since. I dont know if she is right and if i am in the wrong, i dont even know what id do if it was wrong as i dont want to go back to the salons that butchered my hair before.
//
AITA for telling the principal that his punishment was dumb and taking my daughter out for a fun day instead
**
This happened last year before the world fell apart, just asking out of boredom.

My daughter was in second grade. She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn’t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she’s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?
//
AITA for making fun of a girl for her dad's 9/11 death?
**
I go to college in New York state. I am Muslim. I was very young when 9/11 happened, as were the rest of the people in my year.

There's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk.

But today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. 

She said that "you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect." 

I obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.)

She made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said "Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right". I don't know why that set me off, but it did. 

I told her "No, I'm just busy texting my DAD". She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it.

So, reddit, AITA??

Yes, I am aware I have spelling mistakes. I speak Arabic at home.

EDIT: For everyone wondering, the professor was out of the room. He'd already given us our lecture.

AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?
**
I’m 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

I was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

I managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me. 

I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

A year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn’t hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean. 

Last week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD’d and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday.

I immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it. 

I want to go to the funeral service for her but I’m afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. I need to do this for myself. 

AITA for wanting to go?

Aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior
**
I'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. 

To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. 

I have never seen someone storm off so mad. 

Quick edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. 
//
AITA for leaving a fake postive pregnancy test in the bedroom to catch my husband's mom snooping?
**
My MIL moved in with us a month ago. I began to notice my stuff in the bedroom being touched. Furniture rearranged, stuff moved et cetera...


I felt like I was going crazy because my husband is the only one who has access to the bedroom and he doesn't usually touch nor come near my things. I figured it must be his mom walking in and snooping on my personal things. I told my husband and he said his mom would never...I had a huge hunch but couldn't instal a cam in the bedroom to catch her in act.


So, I got me one of those fake postive pregnancy tests and threw it in the bedroom's trashcan. note the trashcan was placed in the corner near the closet.



Literally the next day after I got to work, I got tons of calls and texts from my inlaws "congratulating" me for my "pregnancy". My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a "realization" moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids. I got a lot of shit because of this from him, his mom and family now calling me a liar and manipulator.


AITA?

important info: nothing gets takes or goes missing from the bedroom. just to be clear.
//
AITA for staying true to my threats after my dad died?
**

My dad died unexpectedly last week and my sister Jess and I lost our mom last year to a mix of cancer and the virus. 
From how our family acted in the past over scavenging over dead people’s things both Jess and I decided to send out a family memo on no one is to enter or take anything from our parents house until we get there. Both Jess and I work on the west coast so it takes some time to get there with all of our kids and family. 

I saw several notifications from my parents Ring Doorbell and I’m a lawyer. I reminded my family we will prosecute. Jess and I are on the same page. 
Jess gets to my parents house first and notices stuff is missing and my parents had security cameras and an Alexa show. It shown my cousin taking stuff from the house. So Jess did what we agreed on and called the police and two of our cousins was arrested. Because it was over a thousand dollars both are looking at felonies. My cousin said my dad promised him this stuff and I have my dad’s will making me executor of the estate. I told him he should have waited to file a claim with estate and everyone was warned about what would happen. 
Jess and I don’t have the best relationship with our extended family and We are not dropping charges. Because of this drama dad was quietly cremated with no service and we plan to hold one when scattered our parents ashes at Jess’s house in a tree planted for them. 
My last living grandma is upset about it but she sided with my cousins and aunt saying we are too tough on having them arrested.
//
AITA for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?
**
I love strawberries. I love them so much that I planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.

Lately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

I caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. 

I just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.
//
AITA for teaching my (20M) niece (4F) to say "el chupacabra"when her mom (32F) says "you know what really gets my goat?"
**
Uh basically title I guess. My sister has a habit of saying "you know what really gets my goat", she probly says it 7/8 times a day. So like that tumblr post i taught my niece to say "el chupacabra" when her mom says it (it sounds more like "eh supacaba" tho cause shes four but its adorable). I told my niece it was a monster from Mexico that eats goats and she didnt seem scared or anything, probly cause the only monster she knows is cookie monster, but apparently now my niece walks around the house saying "el chupacabra!" all day and now my sister & brother in law are mad at me for teaching her this, but imo its kind of adorable and also harmless?? But like shes my sisters kid so idk.

META: Warning for all posters: what happens in AITA does not stay in AITA!
**
It would seem that some popular social media personalities have decided that this is a great sub for content. The “God” Facebook page likes to mine AITA content, look for assholes, and put them on blast via TheDodo. A recent poster has also said the the “news” page The Mirror picked up his post as well. I’m sure there are others.

A lot of you post about stuff because your friends and family aren’t on reddit, but now we need to be careful as to what other social media they may be on, and take extra steps to preserve your anonymity. Throwaways are already encouraged, but make sure names are changed enough (not just initials), and change any non-relevant details. Good luck!

Edit: this has made it to r/all, and a lot of folks have pointed out that a bunch of other subs get mined as well. Protect your privacy, people!
//
AITA for refusing to visit my dad after my room was converted to an office/bedroom?
**
I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.

He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with. I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with.

My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.

When I went to visit last month, I was "surprised" with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose.

Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.

I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since.

I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.

My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore.

Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.

Edit: I'm going to be 15 in a few months

Update: AITA for not letting my best friend have her wedding on my property after being uninvited?
**
Here’s original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ob0wdk/aita_for_not_letting_my_best_friend_have_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf


Some stuff has happened recently and many of you have wanted an update on this. Appreciate the reassurance and understanding my decision when seems that many in this situation didn’t. I remained firm in my decision about not letting them use my property for their wedding. Even if they changed their mind about inviting us which honestly I don’t care about anymore. 
Rick’s family (thanks to him) got a hold of my cell so that was more people I had to deal with. I put my foot down with Rick a few days ago and told him directly that I will go to the police and press charges for harassment (I have all the texts and calls documented). Also had a very long talk with Carla about everything going on. She apologized for it all. And she knows it’s her own fault. 

Well she decided to be the one to call things off in the end. Some of my friends still seem to think it’s my fault and I’m taking some distance from them for a while. And also from Carla after getting some confirmation on a few things that I needed to know. Whole thing is a mess. I’m only glad in the end that I didn’t give in to their demands and the constant bugging has stopped.. It still was a huge headache over the last few days and not the kind of drama I want back in my life. Thank you to everyone who made me feel supported in this. It helped a lot not feeling like the only other person (aside from my wife), who thought their demand was insane and inappropriate.
//
AITA for telling a woman who lives in my complex that yes having her husband check me out turns me on?
**
Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track. A lot of people use it to run, walk, etc. I've always used it to run/walk as well. I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.

This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.

So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, "Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?" To which I replied, "Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high." She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. 

I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?
//
AITA for not telling him dinner is ready?
**
My husband has an obsession with TikTok he’s 40 btw not 14. He takes his phone to the bathroom and will spend ages just mindlessly scrolling. We have 2 young kids and I think he just does it for some peace. 
But it means I’m constantly having to go and knock on the door are you ok? Are you going to be long? Will you come and help with the tiny humans? It’s a PITA. 
I was making a full roast dinner and saw him heading off upstairs. I said it’ll be ready in 20 minutes don’t be long.
Set the table, Finished cooking, plated up got the kids to the table and just thought I’m not going to seek him this is ridiculous. I 100% wanted to see how long it would take him to come out on his own- 2 hours and 10 minutes. 
In that time we had finished the meal, I had cleaned the kitchen and the floor, done the dishes and done a load of laundry and the kids were half way through a film.
He came down and and yelled at me that I should have told him the meal was ready. I told him I’m not his mother and it’s not my job to go and seek him. He’s stormed out saying he’s not eating his meal now as roast dinners are rubbish heated in the microwave and this is all my fault and IATA.
//
AITA for telling relatives how much I make and defending my salary?
**
Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad’s relatives who I don’t see very often. 

My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven’t either. He’s rude, condescending, and we don’t agree with him on a lot of things. 

Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job. 

I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I’m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I’ve always wanted. 

Uncle asked “How much are they paying you anyway?” in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. 

I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like “Oh, enough” but I told him the number. 

He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. 

I got pissed and said “I deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can’t do what I do.” 

Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle’s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn’t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. 

AITA?

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he’s a retired airline pilot, so I don’t think he’s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he’s just a jerk.
//
AITA for refusing to accept my parents "gift" and then walking out.
**
throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so I'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when I graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. I remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill I found out the terms and conditions, I can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses I can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so I told my parents that I cant accept the gift as I dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,I also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back I do think that I might be the asshole but I'm unsure so I've come to you. 

I will accept any judgment
//
AITA for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.
**
I’m(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We’re very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. 

So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn’t hurt her, she was following me, I didn’t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn’t answer.


Update: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn’t do anything wrong,she didn’t hurt my brother and it wasn’t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. 

Also little info: this doesn’t happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.
//
AITA for not answering work emails while on vacation resulting in the loss of a client?
**
My husband and I took a much needed vacation to the beach last week and the entire week before we left I sent emails arpund letting everyone know I'd be completely inaccessible for the week so to come and see me for any work materials needed, files etc. I gave everyone everything I knew or thought they'd need and left confident that everyone had prepared themselves, seeing as I'd given them 8 days to prepare.

When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.

In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.

I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.

AITA here?

AITA for buying my boyfriend birthday gifts? I am confused and upset
**
My boyfriend turned 21 last week and I bought him a new video game he had been wanting and a t-shirt.

He started ignoring me and leaving me on read after that.

I asked him what was wrong and he finally said it was unfair that I got him birthday presents because now he's going to have to get me something for my birthday and that I am being manipulative.

I told him no you don't have to get me anything for my birthday but I'd like to spend some time with you that day but he said that it was a "dick move" that I got him gifts. He says I was trying to make him feel obligated. I told him it is the thought that counts and that he doesn't have to get me anything but that if he does, I'd be happy with just a card but he keeps saying he is unsure he can deal with a materialistic girlfriend.

Was it wrong that I got him gifts? I can't understand any more.
//
AITA for making a big deal about 1 extra credit point on my child's test?
**
My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was "Chanukah". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to "Hanukkah". She said to my daughter "you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.

I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.

The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.

My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.
//
AITA for "mansplaining" vaginas to a woman?
**
This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go.

So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said "Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become." There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.

Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking "how me and my dick knows about that". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole "women get looser" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: "Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining."

So I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?
//
AITA for not telling my parents how to read my diary?
**
I am 15f and I have diary, and to prevent my older sister from reading it I created a new alphabet and to make it even harder to decode its not just the Latin alphabet that looks differently, i made some sounds like Yu, Ya, Sh, etc as one letter, like they are in Cyrillic. (Alphabet Russian, Bulgarian, Kazakh etc use)

Well my parents were snooping in my room and found my diary, and are demanding i tell them how to decode it so they can read it. They are saying that i need to share this with them and i can't have secrets from them and im under their roof. I eventually got sick of it and told them to fuck off. They sent me to my room and I'm here. They keep trying to decode my diary which I doubt they will but fuck this sucks.

EDIT: I'm making this post, hopefully this can knock some sense into my parents

Update - WIBTA if I still give my stepson the birthday gift I bought for him despite his mother asking me to hold it off for a month because she knows my gift will upstage hers and she wants to see him enjoy her gift first?
**
Hi Reddit, just dropping by to give you an update to my post. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta\_if\_i\_still\_give\_my\_stepson\_the\_birthday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cyadgx/wibta_if_i_still_give_my_stepson_the_birthday/) 

Jack celebrated his birthday in September, and as many of you suggested, I told him that I'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. 

Kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

For those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. But since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, I bought Jack a horse. My family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

Jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

Thank you all for your comments and I wish everyone the best.

AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.
**
My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.

His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.

When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?
//
AITA for keeping a $300000 prize to myself when I originally planned to share it with my boyfriend?
**
My (26f) boyfriend (27m) is really into cars. He recently discovered a charity project where they fixed up an old Jaguar. It's worth around $300000. You could buy a ticket for $50 to enter and the money went towards a good cause.

My bf is broke at the moment so I offered to go halves with the ticket. He didn't want to because then the car wouldn't be his completely. I wasn't too worried about it and didn't mention it again. I did however buy a ticket for myself.

Well, I won and as of August 1st will be the owner of the car. When my boyfriend found out he was really excited until I told him that I was going to sell it and put half of it in my savings and invest half of it. he said I can't sell OUR car without consulting him. I told him it's MY car and I can do whatever I want. 

He now claims it was all a big misunderstanding and apparently he wanted to go halves but hasn't got around to giving me the money yet. I call bs on it but he keeps saying that we're a couple and we should make decisions together.

AITA for going ahead with the plan to sell the car and keep the money to myself?

Edit. I broke up with him
//
AITA for replying to a rude customer in the language they were speaking in front of me?
**
I'm a slave to the siren (a Starbucks barista). I'm pretty decent with most customers and I'm pretty good at having convos with customers and sensing when someone just wants the line moved forward.

Anyway, I was on register the other day, taking people's orders. Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said "a coffee, black", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely

"Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, hè? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken"

Which is Dutch and translates roughly to 

"Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little"

Then he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. 

He answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.

I realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.

I don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying. But maybe I shouldn't have because of the position I was in at the time (like customer service?)

AITA for refusing to eat from my colleague's vegan birthday cake?
**
I (29f) am working in an office and I have a colleague Bea, who routinely makes fun of vegans. I am vegan and i never make a fuss about food, i go to the same restaurants as my coworkers during lunch hour and i can always find myself something to eat without announcing my dietary choices. Bea keeps calling me out on it though and she's very condescending about it, she keeps saying i am just having a phase and she keeps offering me bites of her lunch that contain cheese and meat, and when i refuse she just goes "oh come on, its vegan i promise!" *winkwink*. Its very childish and annoying and even other people asked her to tone it down, but she insists shes just joking. 

Last week she brought a homemade cake to the office for her birthday, and when she put a slice down in front of me i politely thanked her but i said i cant eat that. She said the cake is vegan and she made it specifically so i could eat it, but knowing her very loose definition of vegan i asked a few questions about the ingredients and she didnt check any of them for milk or eggs, so I thanked her again but refused the slice. She made a big scene out of it, she started crying and saying she just wanted to do something nice for me and now i ruined her birthday. 

Some colleagues told me not to mind her dramatics, but my boss told me that it was her birthday and i could have given her cooking the benefit of the doubt. I sort of see his point, but i also feel like i dont need to justify my food choices to anyone and i never asked her to make the cake vegan for me.

UPDATE: AITA for refusing to give my newborn’s social security number to my aunt.
**
[Link to a snapshot of my OP](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

I was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn’t feel good about giving her Leyla’s social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn’t see anything wrong with it.

After explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn’t have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.

Yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.

Moral of the story: Trust your gut on financial matters. While my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can’t be too careful these days.

AITA for walking out on my job?
**
I(29f) work as a waitress at a restaurant with a point system. It's 1 point if you are late, 3 points to call off with notice, and 5 points for calling off within 4 hours of your shift. This is fine with me as I have no points this year and have only called off once since 2018. I'm the type who covers shifts, stays late and generally just go to do my job.

Last week, I ended up calling off and was out for a week due to being hospitalized in the ICU with a horrible infection. I let my boss know at 2am that I was being sent out by helicopter and kept her informed of everything going on. Today was my first day back. I'm not 100% yet but like many places, we are short staffed. When I came in today, I opened and got to work. My boss came in 2 hours later and called me into her office. She informed me I was getting 8 points, losing my discounts and bonuses for 90 days, and was on probation. I was dumbfounded and told her I wasn't signing the papers as it was out of my control. She said if I didn't, I would be terminated. I told her not to bother and walked out. 

I'm now getting calls and texts from her and my coworkers saying they need me and I was an ass for quiting over something so small. My husband thinks I was in the right because it was ridiculous that I was getting punished for almost dying.

AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson
**
So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.

UPDATE: AITA for kicking out my identical twin for selling nudes online?
**
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fd08eh/aita_for_kicking_out_my_identical_twin_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey yall, so a while back I made a post about how my twin sister started an onlyfans and I was considering kicking her out of our apartment (This is the TL;DR, read the original post for more information). In that post it was determined that I was the asshole. 

A LOT has happened since then, so I decided to make an update.

After reading your comments, I decided that I probably took it to far and although I was embarassed and felt violated, at the end of the day, it is her body and not mine. Just because we look the same does not mean I get to have a say, nor should it affect our relationship.

So, I called her and told her I wanted to talk and we had a really long emotional discussion and I obviously decided to not kick her out as long as she was able to cover her rent going forward.

Then, Covid happened. And as of June, I no longer have a job. I was one of the newest people at the company I was working for and so I was one of the first to go.

And in a turn of events, my sister who has been killing it on onlyfans, is now covering for my portion of the rent until I am able to get back on my feet.

So, thank you for your advice. I might have ruined my relationship with my sister and maybe even be homeless without it.
//
AITA for insisting I get the phone back despite policy?
**
My kids attend a year round school and started back up for the new term 2 weeks ago. My eldest (16F) ended up getting her phone confiscated for using it during class to watch TikTok. We had discussed this before she even got the phone, then had some issues last year. As a last resort, I told her if that happened again, the phone would become mine and she’d get an old flip phone that was my husband’s  with no internet until she could prove trust. 

The school policies had changed this term from a phone would be confiscated until a parent could come get it to a phone would be kept for 2 weeks as a first offense, 3 for second, so on and so forth. I wasn’t okay with this as I don’t trust the school to not lose it (i know they’ve lost/broken other students’ phones) plus I don’t want them having access to my daughter’s private info. I went to the school and requested it back, saying I wouldn’t give it to my daughter but I paid for it. Secretary gave me the spiel and I didn’t blame her but asked to speak with the vice principal. He comes out and repeats them. I said okay but I’m the parent, I paid for it and I never signed anything giving you permission to hold it. They were refusing so I said I’d sit in the office until it was given back. I did so and waited for close to 2 hours. Finally the principal came out and said I needed to leave. I said if I left, I’d be back with a police escort. At that point, the phone was returned to me.


My husband says I “Karen’d” my way out of it. To me, it’s not their property to take. AITA?
//
AITA for giving my wife an ultimatum about getting a dog?
**
I had a dog when my wife and I got married. I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an "aggressive breed", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.

It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being "dangerous".

I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.
//
AITA for telling my SIL she can leave Christmas dinner when she freaked out over tampons?
**
Okay, she’s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She’s my boyfriend’s borther’s girlfriend.

I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We’ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they’ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn’t know was coming).

She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it’s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.

I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn’t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?

Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she’s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.

Jake didn’t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn’t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?

AITA For Offering A Drink To A Girl In A Bar And Then Not Paying For It?
**
I'm m23 and few months ago I was at a nice bar in Toronto with my boys and I saw this really hot girl. Decided to shoot my shot and we spoke and danced for a bit and I offered to buy her a drink and she gladly accompanied me to the bar, when I got there I was like can I have a beer and whatever she wants. She promptly says can I get 4 double shots of 1942. Thats like $75 a shot for a double of 1942 and I was like wtf and she said there for her friends and patted me on the back. When the bartender came back I slapped a $10 bill on the table and told him she'd be covering the shots and walked away. She was pissed and yelling the normal insults lol. 

Well it turns out my mom works with her and they were talking and my mom showed her a picture of me (god damn it mom!) and she instantly recognized me and remembered my name and told my mom about what I did. My mom then called me and said I'm a huge asshole and told me to send her the cost of the 4 drinks which was like $325 with tips. 

I just laughed and told my mom I'm not doing that and my mom said that the girl thinks I'm a huge asshole and douche and she agrees LOL.

AITA for telling my wife that the only reason she says 'money doesn't matter' is because we're rich?
**
I (48M) and my wife (47F) both have very well paying jobs. I am a Pediatric Doctor and she's an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. 

My wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. 

I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. 

Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far.

AITA for showing up to my husband's Dr appointment?
**

My husband has been dealing with sone health issues the past few weeks and has been frequently visiting the dr. I asked if I could go with him but he refused saying it wouldn't be neccesary and when I asked why he wouldn't want me with him he said he felt more comfortable having privacy with his doctor. I jokingly asked if his doctor was a women and he glanced at me.


I anticipated his next dr appointment and decided to go meet him there. He went and 10 minutes later I entered the office (I identified myself as his wife) and he was shocked when he saw me. I greeted his doctor (a man lol) and we talked but my husband refused to even look my way and refused to speak as well.


We left the office together and he went off on me in the car saying I shouldn't have "followed" him and came into the dr office after he asked me for some privacy. I said it was alright I'm his wife I already even know what his issues are and just wanted to show support. He said I overstepped his one boundary and refused to respect his wish and made him more stressed than he already is in these hard times he's going through.


I thought he overreacted but AITA?

AITA for moving back out after my parents demanded I follow their rules
**
This is my first post and im on mobile so apologies if I get it wrong.

I (22 male) just finished college and went back to my hometown while I figure out what I want to do next. I was planning to share an apartment with my old friends, but my parents wanted me to move in to help them out.

Covid has hid them hard and are struggling to pay their bills, so they wanted me to move in and pay rent. I said ok because I wanted to help them out. It all went well until 3 days after I moved in. My mother came in around 9 PM, saying 'I had enough screen time and need to go to bed'. I thought this was ridiculous, because I'm an adult paying rent, they have no right to demand this. She said 'your living under my roof, I make the rules'. I went along with it for the night, and the next morning I went and took my laptop back from their room. She proceeded to ground me, for 'disobeying her authority'.

I had enough of this, called the people I was going to room with and asked if they still had a spot. They said yes, so I packed up and moved in with them. Now my family is hounding me for 'not supporting my family'.

Edit 1: Hello! When I posted this, it says It was removed, so I just left it. I went on the sub yesterday and saw that this actually went through! Im going to go and respond to comments now.

AITA for kicking this girl out of my house after she mistook my UK flag for a confedrate flag? And was planning to get us fired from our jobs?
**
So for a bit of background, we are all in our mid 20s and live in the USA. 

Me and two of my friends rent out a decent size house and we had a get together. My roommate is friends with these two girls call them Kate and Jess, and they invite with them a new friend call her Ashley. Now Ashley when she comes over I see that she is recording us, I thought she was just posting to her Instagram and Snapchat. I don't pay attention to any of it really. 

I notice that she is just video taping a lot, so I am like Kate can you check on your friend like whats going on? Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting "Evidence against us." When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. 

But I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. 

Some of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her.
//
AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?
**
My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.

SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.

Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?

AITA for being upset because my son didn’t talk to me, but talked to my wife.
**
I’m 40M, my wife is 39F, son in 15. 

Yesterday when it was dinner time I called him to come downstairs few times. He didn’t answer me so I assumed that he didn’t hear me. I went upstairs and knocked on his door, he said he’d come downstairs in few minutes. After 15 minutes he still didn’t come downstairs so I walked in his room. I knocked first. He was obviously crying. I asked him what was wrong but he didn’t answer me so I didn’t push him more. 

 I went downstairs and told my wife about it. She went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. She came back and brought him food upstairs. When I asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn’t anything important and told me to drop it. I got kind of upset because I want to know what was wrong and I’m his parent as well. 

I haven’t been fully ignoring them but I’ve been acting kinda distant since yesterday. My wife got mad at said that I was acting extremely immature.
//
AITA for giving my son a bill for half his expenses?
**
My son (17) asked me for a new gaming system and I said no because he already has plenty of gaming systems and games and doesn’t need more. If he wants one he can save up and buy one.

He then comes to me with a budget on how we can “afford” the system. It was mostly just that if I buy nothing for myself for 2 months, we’ll have enough for the system. I told him hell no, it’s offensive and if he wants the system he has to save up for it.

Then he comes back with another budget. He and his father calculated how much I’ve been paid in child support over the years and they decided it would be a good idea to let me know how little a drop in the bucket the gaming system would be. I told him I spend that on his expenses every month but he didn’t believe me, so I told him that if he doesn’t think so, he can pay me for his expenses every month and I’ll give him the child support.

Surprise surprise, when I gave him the bill, it showed that when you factor in all of the things I pay for in a month, it’s much more than child support. Child support doesn’t even cover 30%. Now my ex is yelling at me for making our son feel like an expensive burden, but I think I was teaching him a lesson about money and unteaching him some of what my ex says about support. AITA for giving him a bill?

ETA: not able to comment, but just wanted to say this isn’t a question of being able to afford the console. I can afford it, but that doesn’t mean he should just get it.

AITA for turning the home I inherited into an Airbnb? My sister thought it would be a “family home” forever.
**
 I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let’s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M

I got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time.

 My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She’s my older sister and I’ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?
//
AITA for walking out after a boss tried to refuse to accept my resignation?
**
I had a boss who was a real turd. He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. 

I turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you’re here to stay.” I got so furious and decided that was it. I said “well screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. 

A former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?

AITA for kicking out my dad and his pregnant wife out of the home I legally own after they sent my depressed sister to live with our aunt?
**
My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it. The other vacation home went to my 16 year old sister.

Our father remarried 6 months after mom passed away and moved his new wife in. My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.

Recently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.

The night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.

My dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.

His wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.

I was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.

My father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.

AITA for giving away my grandparents’ gift intended for my fiancé
**
Every year, my grandparents give $300 to their single grandchildren and $500 to their married grandchildren, along with a note that says “to share with your spouse”. When opening up our gifts this year, I noticed my cousin, who had recently married his gay boyfriend, only received $300 while my fiancé and I received $500. I handed two hundreds from my envelope to my cousin in front of everyone, which caused quite the scene. 

My family is very religious and refuse to accept gay marriage as legitimate. They refuse to acknowledge his husband as a member of our family and tell him he is going to hell unless he changes his lifestyle. 

I defended my decision by saying, “we’re not married yet, and they are. I think there’s been a mistake”. Conversations quickly devolved, resulting in both my cousin and I leaving shortly after. 

My family insights it was not my money to give and my actions disrespected both my grandparents and my fiancé. My fiancé feels my family was welcoming her, and I rejected her in front of everyone. AITA?

AITA For quitting on the spot even though we were understaff and it made my manager cry?
**
I worked at a retail store in the mall. The store is divided into men’s, women’s and children’s clothes. I always worked women’s and on the weekdays I was always the only employee in that entire section. 

Yesterday myself and two other employees clocked into ours shifts. My manager Lisa pulled my aside and told me “Your dads called the store five times asking for your schedule please tell him to stop”. I got extremely confused because that didn’t sound like something my dad would do. I even texted him and he said he never called the store once. I had a bad feeling and asked Lisa if she gave “my dad” my schedule and she did she did. I then told her that wasn’t my dad and she had no right telling a strange man my schedule. She got annoyed and told me that it wasn’t a big deal and I was being dramatic. 

I then quit on the spot which only left her and two other employee to watch the entire store. She kept apologizing and even burst into tears because they were understaffed.

AITA for changing my name? my parents named me Qur'stylle (Chrystal)?
**
So my asshole scumbag parents named me Qur'stylle and my whole life i have gotten shit like "are you muslim" "what language is your name originated from?" "what country are you from" and people butchering its pronunciation, for obvious reasons. I have always told people to just spell it as Chrystal and my parents (mainly mom) would take huge offense to it and would email my teachers every year to make sure they pronounce my name correctly. 

My mom even grounded me once because I told people to just make save my name as Chrystal in their contacts. Now that I'm a legal adult i got my named changed to Chrystal so now i don't have to deal with this fuckign bullshit for the rest of my life. Having this bullshit spelling and having to correct everyone everyday was annoying as hell and everyone before they met me would always think I'm some spoiled brat bitch when that isn't true at all. Your name affects how people see you, much of it is subconscious, and having these bullshit spellings is not good. 

My mom lost her shit and started crying and threatened to cut me off for doing this. She said i betrayed her and our family by doing this. Im pretty sure I'm in the right but i need a sanity check here. I told my mom to go fuck herself and fuck her for causing me all these problems in my life and not supporting me and taking my complaints into considerations over my own fuckign name. My mom is a cunt and my dad is a spineless coward.

UPDATE: AITA I am dying and want to have a catch-up with my first love
**
Hi, This is S's husband and she passed away after 5 weeks of posting this. I just looked into this account/phone before 2 days. She never told me about A herself. But we live in a small town and everyone knows about everyone's business including rumors. So i kind of knew about this vaguely. A did come to see her as a courtesy once her illness became known to people in our place. 

She was a very nice human being, a dutiful wife and daughter and i really miss her. She was also my best friend and confidante. She was a genuinely nice and kind person and she deteriorated quite quickly post her diagnosis. 

I just saw this account in her phone and am planning to have a chat with A to see if he would be willing to organise a scholarship (paid by me with her inheritance) in her memory to sponsor the higher education of few kids every year and making them self-sufficient. This is something she wanted to do. I am still not sure if i should tell A that i know their history. But thats a different discussion for a different day.

I wish she had been one of those miraculous recoveries where doctors aren't even sure how something happened. She was a very warm and loving person and thanks to everyone who had messaged her asking for updates, checking on her. Thanks again.

AITA for telling my roommate that the name she chose for her baby is ‘ridiculously stupid’?
**
My roommate  (24f) is a big Game of Thrones fan. She’s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, ‘Arya’. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.

The next day, which was yesterday, she said she’s found a way to name her baby ‘Arya’ and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. 

She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name.

AITA? My husband won’t let me sleep.
**
Ok, so I work 12 to 16 hour shifts at an extremely labor intensive job that requires the use of heavy machinery. My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled. Now my husband is angry and says that it hurts his feelings that I am no longer sleeping next to him every night. AITA?

META You can still be the asshole if you were wronged
**
I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, I've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. OP was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. Their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? And there is a resounding chorus of NTA! You don't owe anyone anything! Or someone was mean to OP, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. AITA?  No! They were rude so you get to be as well! 

I dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. Sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. These reactions are understandable. But just because its understandable doesn't mean OP can't be the asshole. 

Being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. People make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  It is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. "They started it" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now. 

This sub isn't "was this person in the wrong to do this to me" its "am I the asshole."  ESH exists. NAH exists. "NTA, but you should still apologize/try better next time" exists. Let's all try and be a little more nuanced&empathetic.

AITA for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children
**
Saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn’t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I’ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they’re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn’t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I’m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn’t think the triplets had different fathers. I’m not an idiot. I thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair

UPDATE: AITA for the way I reacted to my parents open relationship and no longer paying rent
**
Its been over a week since I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xnpygp/aita_for_the_way_i_reacted_to_my_parents_open/). Thank you guys for your Judgments and advice. I have blocked my parents on everything and have gone no contact. After just over a week I already feel like a new person without them in my lives. My boyfriend has been my rock through all this, I was a mess of tears and anger the first few days and he's the one who got me through it. Im currently staying with him (renting) but we have been looking for our own place together since the lease on the current place runs out soon. I went to my gp and got a mental health plan done up so I should be seeing a therapist soon, free of charge. Its not a huge update but Im doing a lot better in so little time from just cutting them out of my life, Im looking forward to the future.

AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?
**
Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- I was wearing headphones all the time.

\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.

\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.
//
AITA for not letting my boyfriend name our daughter Renesmae?
**
My boyfriend and I are both 18, and 35w pregnant with our daughter. Since the day I found out we were having a girl he was hell bent on naming her Renesmae, absolutely refuses to compromise. He's a massive twilight fan, I personally hate it and would much rather that we don't name our baby after a fictional character. 

It kinda hit boiling point last night, for weeks I've been telling him we are coming up with something else becaudr I'm not naming my child that. I went onto Instagram where he had posted a picture of us and said in the caption "I can't wait to meet you Renesmae."

I got really really mad my this. I told him to delete that, or change the caption because I'm not naming our daughter that. He refused, saying his friends knew now so we had to stick with it. I said "I haven't fucking agreed to naming our daughter after some stupid made up character from the worst books ever fucking made. Delete the post now or get the fuck out of my house". 

He left to spend the night at a friends and my parents who heard the argument said I should just let him name our daughter that, saying it probably means a lot to him and that I'm being an unreasonable asshole. AITA?

Edit: Feel the need to add, I have a stutter and can't even say Renesmae out loud, I would much rather name my child something I can say.

Stop trying to adopt my child. She is very much loved and wanted.
//
AITA for leaving the family restaurant and starting my own after finding out I wouldn't inherit it?
**
My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.

I've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.

I found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.

I was pissed and "quit" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.

Now this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. 

My dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.

I declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.

The family restaurant however, is going under.  

Now there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.

AITA for telling the teacher to stop making comments on my wheelchair?
**
I'm 18f, have a pretty messed up pair of legs, have had since birth, I can walk but am an ambulatory wheelchair user. I'm currently due an upgrade for my chair, I've had it close to 7 years and it's a bit messed up. It's gotten pretty uncomfortable and it makes noise but like I said, I've had it 7 years and I've grown rather attatched to it. We're saving to pay for the new one at the moment.

I have one teacher, my English teacher, who constantly makes comments about how banged up looking it is, and gets pretty pissed any time I dare move and it makes noise. She says it's distracting. The comments about the appearance of the chair annoy me a lot because it's hardly going to look brand new after 7 years of constant use.

She made a comment this morning along the lines of "You know, you should really get a new one, that one looks like it's about to collapse under you". I got really mad about this and I said, "You know what, if you think I should get a new chair so bad, you can pay the nearly 4 grand it's gonna cost or you can stop making nasty comments about something that literally doesn't affect you." 

She didn't really look at me until the end of the class but the boy who sits besides me said it was slightly assholeish as she probably didn't realise how difficult the process was. AITA?
//
AITA for being livid at my (now) husband?
**
My (33F) husband (30M) and I got married last week.  I had been super chill throughout the whole wedding planning, and during the actual event.  Because I know sh\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.

Well, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?
//
AITA for screenshotting messages guys sent me and sending them to their mothers?
**
I'm an 18 year old girl who is in college atm. I've been getting bullied/harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and nsfw pictures that i'm sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail. I should have reported them or just blocked them but I had, had enough so I screenshot every message they'd sent me and found their mothers through their facebook pages and sent screenshots to them including an explanation of who I am and how their sons have been bothering me.

Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side. Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their Mothers and also how I don't know what their home life is like. 

Am I the asshole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?

Edit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.

Edit 2: also whoever reported me as worried about my current mental health...thanks? I mean i'm honestly good but thanks.
//
AITA ruining my friend's birthday party by taking back the cake I baked for her?
**
My friend is quirky. She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.

I spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). 

On her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. 

I was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. 

I got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. 

She got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. 

My friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this. 

AITA here?

AITA for suing my biological father for unpaid child support?
**
I don't have a relationship with my biological father. He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. 

While I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.

I've seen his wife's social media, and she's posting about "bastards wanting a payday" and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn't have just used the legal system to get money that wasn't technically mine. AITA?
//
AITA for saying my secret workout routine is depression?
**
I (25F) had a miscarriage in early January this year. I lost my mother to a completely unexpected heart attack in February. We used to be very very close and her death, coupled with the loss of my child devastated me. I slipped into depression, developed anorexia and lost a huge amount of weight in a very short time. I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. 

I attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my "transformation". 

There was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my "secret workout routine" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of "I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. 

I lost my patience and told her that "I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.

Turns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for "embarrassing his sister on his wedding". I've refused to apologise as of now and I'm not sure if I should.

AITA for going to a different hotel during my vacation with my husband?
**
It our first real vacation since 2020 and my first with just my husband and in over 10 years. 

Our daughter Annie (17) was left home alone. For some reason recently Annie can do no right in hubby’s eyes. Dress, music, chores. He has deemed her irresponsible. It farthest from the truth. She has a summer job and makes good grades. She’s in-fact kinda a hermit for her age. 

Unknown to me my husband set the hot water heater to refill only once a day while we are gone. Annie did some dishes and laundry. She took a shower and the water was cold. She was upset and thought it broke and called us panicking. 

My husband yelled into her for wasting our hot water and telling her how irresponsible she was enough to make her cry. 

I got madder than I ever have in this marriage and basically said most parents would love to have a 17 year old like Annie. We argued and screamed all night so next day I left the resort to a little hotel down the street. My husband as been trying to call me and I told Annie to block her father and don’t pay attention to him.

My husband is mad about the wasted money on this vacation but I can’t stand to even look at him over an argument over something so stupid and preventable.
//
AITA for telling everyone exactly why I'm getting divorced?
**
My ex and I have one child together. We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. 

Not to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. 

He ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't "deal" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. 

I have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce "problems" and that he couldn't handle raising a "r******" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. 

I was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action. I made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. I'm now getting calls and messages for "making a private issue public" and "parental alienation". AITA?

AITA for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?
**
My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that "fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

I noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?

UPDATE to AITA for telling my disabled son and his partner I disapprove of their relationship?

My original posting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_disabled\_son\_and\_his\_partner](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c6lmmh/aita_for_telling_my_disabled_son_and_his_partner)

My son has moved back in with me last weekend.

The older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

I got a phone call from my son on Saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

I jumped into my car and brought him home. I also yelled at the man and told him I'm calling the cops.

I then called an officer I knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

When we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

So while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

I'm happy he is rid of that predator but I'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

I have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

I hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

Thank you to everyone for telling me I wasn't completely crazy.

AITA for sending my son to school in a dress
**
My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said "I want to wear this." I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as "the one who wore a dress" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA

AITAH for giving guardianship of my son to my aunt over my mother after I die of my terminal cancer
**
I (21m) have a son who just turned 1, his mum who was my girlfriend died in labour along with the other baby she was carrying. I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.

I had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.

My mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home. I understand that things are terrible for her right now as I won't be here soon but my aunt is a much better choice. It's not like my son won't know who she is as the walk between hers and my aunts is only 5 minutes. 

Am I the asshole?
//
AITA I went with my friend to a restaurant that was originally reserved for me and my wife.
**
Yesterday was my birthday. My(30M) wife(28F) and I had made reservations at this really nice Korean BBQ restaurant for dinner. My wife is 4 months pregnant. 

However, her friend wanted to hang out with her and had called her the night before my birthday. My wife said that this was a childhood friend of hers and that she really wanted to spend time with her. I reminded her that it's my birthday but she just dismissed it saying my birthday comes every year but her friend will be leaving for Germany in a few weeks. I told her that she could go after my birthday as well but she did not listen and just went to a sleepover at her friend's place. 

I got really mad at her and instead of waiting for her to return home to talk things out, I asked my friend if he would like to hang out with me. He was fine with it so we spent the day fishing, grilling, hiking, and went to the Korean BBQ for dinner. 

When she came home after spending time with her friend, she apologized to me saying it was an unavoidable circumstance. I told her that it wasn't a problem and that I spent the day with my best friend. She got mad that I'd take him to the restaurant that we had booked for ourselves. I said that it was originally for us but since she prioritized her friend over me, I took the person who prioritized me on my birthday. She said that I'm controlling and that I shouldn't be deciding who she spends time with. 

Now she's neither talking to me nor coming out of the room. I think I went too far by telling her whom she should be spending time with.  

AITA?
//
AITA for banning my father from my home because he banned me from his when I was younger?
**
When I was 15, my father married a woman I just could not get along with. And there was a lot of friction with her daughter as well.

Eventually, the fighting got so bad that my father told me that he would exercise his custody at my grandparents house instead, effectively banning me from his own home.

I said thanks but no thanks and stopped seeing him as per the custody schedule.

He did make attempts to fix our relationship but I wasn't interested. We would see each other at family events and we were nice enough to each other but that's it.

It's now 13 years later and I'm married with a 1 year old.

His wife has passed away in an accident a few years ago and I'm assuming he's lonely now.

But I don't really want to be his backup plan.

He comes to see my son once a month and I only see him at the park and don't engage much with him myself.

Last December, he point blank asked me why I never invited him to my home for dinner or why I never accepted his invites to visit him.

I told him the the truth. He was very upset but it's the reality of the situation.

Was I the asshole?
//
AITA for not paying for my daughter's wedding because she invited my brother and his family
**
I'm 46M, my brother 48M.

When I was 20, my then girlfriend cheated with my brother. I was heartbroken and pissed. I told him he is no longer my brother. Despite my request, my family didnt cut him off, so I told them that I will never again be in the same place as he is. If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.

My daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.

I was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.

My ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected. Am I asshole for that?
//
AITA for reporting my teacher over a very uncomfortable joke?
**
I (F20) have been in a bakery course since September and every Wednesday we have an 8 hour hands on class. The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. 

Last week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. 

It's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. 

So today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. 

Now he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. 

AITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?

Edit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this much of a response. Thank you all for your thoughts, upvotes, and the awards. I've gathered some useful information and I feel better knowing that people support me, even though they're strangers on the internet. Thanks guys.
//
AITA for telling my mom I'm not making her choose because I'm happy to be left out
**
I'm (26f) recently divorced after learning my sister (27f) and husband were having an affair. I cut my sister off the day I found out. We have not spoken since, we have not been in the same room for more than ten seconds and I will not have a relationship with her moving forward. This year has been rough and Covid made some things easier regarding there was no visiting family so the pressure was gone. But recently my mom wanted to have a family dinner again and I told her I would not go because I did not want to be in my sisters presence. She told me I can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. I told her I can and I will. Her response was telling me I am being unfair making her choose between us and I said I'm not making her choose because I'm fine not being invited, I know my stance means I will end up being excluded. But I will not play nice with her and my ex. Especially now that they are getting married too. We're never going to play happy families. I don't want to be civil to them. So I would rather not have anything to do with them. And they will never have anything to do with me again.

My mom thinks I'm being very unfair.

AITA?

Edited to add since this was asked: My dad died 9 years ago.
//
AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn’t stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?
**
Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.

Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place. I’m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. 

So, was I the asshole?
//
AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?
**
I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a "trip" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. 

Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. 

I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.

I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.

Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.

So, AITA?

Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them.
//
AITA for searching my husband's pants without asking him first?
**


Context: my husband [33] used to be unemployed for a year, he recently started a job at a warehouse. 

Yesterday, and while I was about to do the laundry, I grabbed his work pants and digged my hand in it's pockets to empty them before putting it in the washing machine like I  always do. 

My husband just happened to walk by and when he saw me searching his pants pockets. He rushed in yelling at me to put his pants down. I already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how I have no respect for his privacy and that I shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. 

He refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it. I asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. Then went back to not speaking to me.


I'm genuinely confused, AITA?
//
AITA for changing the package pickup each time someone uses my email for orders?
**
So pretty much, there’s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn’t using any other personal information of mine so i don’t think it’s a privacy concern. 

So back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I’ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.

With most emails, there’s a number, name and an address (I’m assuming it’s the persons address) attached. I’ve tried texting the number and even calling but I’ve never gotten an answer. 

I’d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I’ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can’t change that since like I said, it’s all attached to my email.

I recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is “abc” his is “acb”) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. 

In his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can’t he just use his own email he said: It’s always a typo I do and I don’t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.

I’m not even joking, that’s exactly what he said.

So AITA for sabotaging this guys packages?
//
AITA for making an uncomfortable joke when my friend told me her dinner table was full with family?
**
Over the last 20 years everyone is my close family has died. Both my parents are gone, my grandparents on both sides, all my dad's uncles, and anyone who is still alive are scattered out among the country. All I(20f) have left is my siblings and my BIL.

My friend (23f) comes from a different family. All the uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents have monthly parties, stay in touch, have big celebrations, the works. All of them are still alive and active.

I think she knows I'm sensitive to the topic as I wish I had a big family, as she sometimes makes these comments like 'You know when you get married your guest list will be so small compared to mine...but hey at least it will be cheap!' At my mom's funeral there were still a lot of open chairs and she told me if this was a family member of hers all the seats would be full. (She is aware of my many, many deceased family members)

I took some pictures of me, my siblings, and my BIL cooking for Thanksgiving and us playing games at the dinner table and post them on social media. She text me privately saying we looked like we were having fun, followed by pics of her huge family, and remarked the dinner table was full of family. This is where I maybe the asshole, I replied, lovely! Have fun, we'd have a full table too but with the snow it's was too hard to dig everyone out of their graves.

She was silent for a few hours then replied that joke was morbid and made her uncomfortable, and I really need to check my attitude.

AITA?
//
AITA for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.
**
throwaway, and I will be keeping this is Anonymous as I can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. 

AITA?

edit 1 
I've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him.

UPDATE - AITA for allowing my 8 year old to shave her head?
**
[My original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g43da4/aita_for_allowing_my_8_year_old_daughter_shave/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So many of you guys said that I am NTA. The people who told me I was TA said that because she would regret that decision.

We shaved her head almost a month ago. Just a few nights ago she asked me to shave it again for her since she really liked it. I was more than happy to do it.

I do plan on buying her a wig or two off of Amazon before she goes back to school in case she regrets it and wants to wear it to school but take it off at home.

I just want to make it clear - my husband's side of the family (her dad) was fully supportive (after all, her cousin inspired her to do it) I'm also spending less on shampoo and conditioner (she had super long hair)

As for my side of the family who was upset about it - some of them had a change of heart after she talked to them herself and told them that she was really happy with her decision. The other few think that she was forced to say she was happy, but I don't care.

My mom, who was the one who forwarded the picture to my family, apologized. She told me she did it because she thought she looked adorable but should have asked me first. But she was supportive of us.

My daughter wants me to let everyone know that if you really want to shave your head, just do it. According to her, she loves the way it feels on her pillows (she has silk pillowcases) and she liked feeling the shower and rain on her head.
//
AITA for demanding my mom apologize after she blew up at my girlfriend who she thought was being racist?
**
I’m black and my girlfriend is Filipino. My parents aren’t the biggest fans just because we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and they don’t think I should be with a “rich girl”

My parents came over for dinner last night and my girlfriend was going to cook. Neither of us cook much and we eat way too much takeout, so she decided to make fried chicken because it is something she made with her mom growing up. Her mom came here from the Philippines and I guess it is pretty popular over there.

When my mom saw the fried chicken she thought that my girlfriend was either making fun of her or just going off a racial stereotype. She immediately started cussing at her and demanding an apology. I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.

She calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave. I’m not talking to her until she apologizes but I don’t know if that is too harsh.
//
AITA for taking an Uber to a wedding so I wouldn't be late?
**
My sister got married last weekend.  I flew into town and my parents insisted that I stay with them instead of a hotel like I wanted.  

My parents are consistently late for everything.  I think it's a Latin thing.  I hate being late.  I think it's disrespectful.  

The wedding was at 2:30.  My folks live about half an hour from the church.  

Noon rolls up and my folks aren't even getting ready yet.  

They are adults and I am over dealing with them. 

I get ready. I send for an Uber and I am at the church for 2:00. 

I check in with my sister.  She asks me if I had any problems getting my parents to church. I told her that I came by myself.  Shebw my white and said that I was responsible for getting them there on time.  

Well nobody asked me to do that.  I didn't even want to stay there.  

So now everyone starts calling my parents.  They are getting ready.  

They were about 35 minutes late.  

The service was shortened because there was another wedding later that day.  

Everyone is still mad at me for not getting my parents there on time.  My aunt said that I'm an asshole for messing up the timing of the wedding. 

My mom says it's my fault for not reminding them to get ready.  

Am I the only one who thinks adults should be able to be on time for their own kid's wedding without help?
//
AITA for refusing my to buy my fiancé gaming laptop for a few grand after he told me to find a real job?
**
My fiancé (m37) and I (f30) have started living together 6 months ago. I own a house and he moved in with me. I run online business from home which allows me to live rather comfortably. 
A month after moving in, he quit his job saying how much he hated it and that he’s going to try and do twitch streaming for a living. 
Im all for following your passion so I was supportive although surprised at the turn of events. I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.

Anyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel. Sure, he’s gaming all day but hasn’t bothered to even try and create an account, he just games for pleasure. It’s been 7 months. 
I’ve had conversations with him suggesting he finds work but he keeps telling me that I’m unsupportive and he needs time.

He wanted us to buy a bigger house together but I said that I’m fine with my current one and that since he doesn’t have a job, I don’t want to get mortgage and be left with paying everything and he told me that if I found a real job maybe I wouldn’t have financial problems.
We had a massive argument that night.
Now, he’s been hinting at needing new gaming laptop which costs a few grand and I’ve been ignoring it so he asked outright for me to buy it for his birthday.

I told him no that my fake job doesn’t cover new laptops and he got really pissed at me, telling me I’m selfish and am ruining his career.
Granted, I can afford it to buy it but he really hurt me saying my business is not a real job despite me working my ass off. AITA for not buying him new laptop?
//
AITA? for refusing to sign anything while my eyes are blindfolded?
**



Eversince I got out of the hospital for chronic problems, My husband has been introducing me to some games every evening. One game used to be about doing things while my eyes are blindfolded. involving puzzles, ruby's cube, shaped objects et cetra.... We'd take turns to do it just for entertainment.



Just a couple of days ago, he's been trying to get me to sign papers while wearing a blind fold. I refused to do it because he never lets me take a look at what I'm signing neither before or after. He says that he was just trying to see if I could leave the same signature everytime I sign but I couldn't help feel uncomfortable. I told him I don't want to play this game unless and until he shows me the papers first, he said "nevermind then" and stopped bringing it up.


Last night, he tried to convince me to give it a try and even volunteered to go first, I asked if he was going to show me what I was going to sign and he made a face and said no, it's the rules and I should respect them. I refused and he kept on about how I keep acting worried and suspicious for no reason. he said I clearly don't trust him and he was hurt by finding that out now after everything we been through. We had an argument and I told him to drop it and not bring it up again, period. He was mad despite saying it was no big deal, he was obviously upset with me and kept talking about how I don't trust him and that I was out of line to assume or suspect anything from him like this. I might be paranoid but I couldn't help it. I do think I was ta to him after he stood by my side when my own family didn't even visit.
//
AITA for asking my husband to check on me while playing video games?
**
My husband is an avid computer gamer - mostly WoW-type games. Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.

A few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.

It dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different? AITA?
//
AITA for refusing to let my sister and her kids move into the house that I bought?
**
I'm a 32 year old woman and I just bought my first house. It has 3 bedrooms, a yard and is just what I need right now. I'm single and have 2 dogs.  My sister is 34, has 3 children and lives in a 2 bedroom apartment. Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them.

&#x200B;

 When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being "wasteful" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space. I reminded her that what I do with my hard earned money is none  of her business. She went on to complain to our mother about how "selfish" I was being. Yesterday evening, I got a call from my mom telling me I should let my sister and her kids move into the house. MY house.

&#x200B;

I told her that no one was going to live in the house that I paid for but me, and that extra space would be great for my dogs to play in. My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a "compromise". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor. 

&#x200B;

I told her she had lost her mind and hung up. 

Am I the asshole, or is she? I know my sister is struggling financially but this kind of entitlement is ridiculous.
//
AITA for telling my daughter to get over herself?
**
I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

My son says I’m being terrible and I need to re-evaluate my life. AITA?
//
AITA for refusing my future sister in law's request to dye my hair for my brother's wedding?
**
My future SIL Liz has turned into a bridezilla and is going to war with everyone over every stupid thing.

My natural color is red. I love my hair. Liz is a blonde but she loves to have red hair and in fact ever since meeting me she's been dying her hair almost exactly my color. I don't mind, I think it's weird that she does it but I don't have a monopoly over this particular shade of red and she's free to do with her hair whatever she wants.

Well, she asked me this week that I should dye my hair to a different color because she wants her hair to be unique in her wedding, she offered to cover all the costs as well. I just said no because it's my hair, I don't want it changed.

I told my brother and he told me to do whatever I want because it's my hair, he said he'll talk to Liz to get her to back off. Well it didn't work because Liz has come to my parents and they've taken her side! They say it's her special day and we need to be more accomodating and it's important for our future relationship that we get along. I believe I am accomodating, she can do whatever she wants with her own hair! How is my hair any of her business anyway.

My parents tell me that I should be the bigger person. I don't know why an 18 year old should be the bigger person compared to the 27 year old Liz. They told me I'm making this minor issue into a big problem and I should just do what she wants because it's her wedding.

AITA for not giving in?

UPDATE: AITA for proposing to my girlfriend with a video game relic and refusing to buy a ring when asked

UPDATE: AITA for proposing to my girlfriend with a video game relic instead of a ring and refusing to purchase a ring after

Hello everyone, here’s a link to my previous post from a month ago in which I proposed to my girlfriend with the Amulet of Mara from skyrim, and was a big asshole (as many of you pointed out) because she wanted a more traditional ring. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j6vh3c/aita_for_proposing_to_my_girlfriend_with_a_video/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Well, here’s an update for you. We got married! 

I realized pretty quickly after posting my original post that I was the asshole and my feelings were hurt because I’m an idiot. So we picked out a ring together, and in that we decided, hey, let’s just elope! So we both picked out a ring, and now we’re married. 

Thank you for everyone who tried to knock some sense into me. I am very happy with my wife, and I’m glad we both got what we wanted.


She also wore the amulet as we got married, but she didn’t want me to post any of our actual wedding photos on the internet so I’m just posting the rings.

That’s it, we’re happy, a ring was bought and now we’re just enjoying nerdy married life.

Edit: I removed the photo of our rings. I will not have people insult my wife. She is a ridiculously beautiful woman, but that isn’t the most important thing. She is compassionate and smart as hell. She’s the funniest person I know, and has such quick wit she’ll put you on your ass laughing. 

But you people can’t get passed her (I think adorable) hands, so no more photos. Sorry.

Final edit: I’m not sure if this is allowed, and if not I’m very sorry but my wife created a discord server for people who genuinely just want to see the rings, so message me if interested I suppose.

AITA for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto FB who died during the 9/11 attacks?
**
I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said "I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me."

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.
//
AITA for calling a woman an idiot when she refused listen to why my daughter isn't vaccinated?
**
My (20f) 2yo daughter has had a heart transplant due to CHD and is severely immune compromised, as a result she cannot recieve live virus vaccines.

I'm in a young mom's group on Facebook and the topic of daycares and being a SAHM came up. I said my boyfriend is the breadwinner and I stay at home with our daughter because I can't risk sending her to a daycare as she's not vaccinated. 

One woman, who is the same age as me with a newborn, started off, she's a new member, all the other women already know of my daughters medical history. She started calling me names and said I don't belong here if I'm so anti-vax. I told her my daughter is a transplant patient and can't be vaccinated. She just told me stop making excuses.

I said, "you're an absolute idiot, if you even looked at my profile for a second you'd know that I'm an advocate for vaccines and if you did a bit of research you'd know that giving someone who is severely compromised a live virus vaccine is a bad idea."

She was clearly very upset, she posted a rant about me onto the group and a few of the members said I was an asshole for calling her an idiot.AITA?

Edit: If I could vaccinate my daughter or if I was confident every parent who sends there child to a daycare vaccinates their child, I would send her to one so I can work.

Edit 2: I am not talking about the covid vaccine here
//
AITA for telling my new neighbours that I've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?
**
I've been away since Thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently Sunday afternoon where I live.  Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes "Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it." (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said "I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox." I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.

Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnapped

AITA?

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Thanks for your judgement everyone. I honestly thought it was going to have a different outcome because I felt horrible after the police arrived, like what I said was incredibly wrong of me (which it is, don’t do what I did). But I’m disabling reply notifications

Also, I am Australian
//
AITA for my response after my BIL said my dress was inappropriate for a family gathering?
**

Ugh! Hear me out!


So My bil (my husband's brother) was married to a women from Greece, Her name is *"Nana"*, and the reason for their divorce was because of how much my conservative bil tried to control her cloths and the places she went. He didn't want the divorce and was hopping Nana would accept the life he offered and stay but she didn't.


This happened 2 years ago, he now moved back with my inlaws and we'd see him more often. He tried to comment on how I dress on multiple ocassions and it's unbearable. but since my inlaws said he's struggling and depressed then I let it go.

On friday my inlaws celebrated my husband's 30th birthday at their home. I wore a heart-shaped blue dress and had my hair up. While we were eating my BIL pointed at me and said that my cleavage was showing and that I shouldn't have wore this dress because it looked inappropriate for a family gathering. I was utterly shocked, everyone was staring at me and I felt so embarrassed and on the spot. He looked at me waiting for me to blow up probably but I laughed and told him "Knock, knock! he said "Who’s there?", I said "Nana". Now he paused and seemed confused at the mention of this name. He then faked a laugh and said "Nana who?" I said "Nana your goddamn business what I’m wearing! ok!". He got upset and quickly left the table. My SILs laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that I was way out of line for bringing up Nana to my BIL knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. His mom said that I was petty and didn't need to dig at him just to prove a point.


My husband thinks I'm in the wrong as well and that I was being deliberately hurtful by bringing up Nana.
//
AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it
**
I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?
//
AITA for threatening to financially cut off my son over a baby name?
**
I had my son fairly young and I recently had a change of life baby. When I was four months pregnant my son, who was in college at the time told me that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. I wasn't very happy but I've been supportive and I've given them a lot of financial assistance.

I had my daughter two months ago and named her Clara. My son's girlfriend went ballistic. She said they were going to name their daughter Clara and that I should have consulted with them (umm I got pregnant first, but whatever) I told her she needs to grow up and that she doesn't own the name. My son asked me if I would consider changing Clara's name. I said no and he stormed out of the house.

Well they told me the other day they are going to name their daughter Paxtyn. I guess I made a face and she started yelling at me that it is my fault, because I stole the only name she likes. I even asked her if she likes the name Paxtyn and she said she is going to like it when I have to tell my friends I have a granddaughter named Paxtyn. So she pretty much said she hates me more than she loves her daughter.

My son said I have two months to fix this (change Clara's name) and I told them that they are both idiots, and I feel bad for their future child. I also said if they name their daughter Paxtyn just to be spiteful I will not give them any further assistance. My son called me up and said I was being controlling, but when I asked him if he actually likes the name he hung up

Edit: They never mentioned the name Clara to me

Second Edit: Alright, I took some of your advice and texted her that I've been thinking about it and I kind of like the name Paxtyn and she wrote back "fuck you, you evil bitch" so I think that's the end of their money.
//
AITA for kicking my friend out the car?
**
Earlier today, I was driving my friends back home after we worked out. We passed these two girls walking and one of my friends rolls down his window and says "I like how those t****** jiggle, how about you give the boys a flash." I instantly got angry when he said that. I pulled around the corner and told him to get out. He thought I was joking but I wasn't and he started arguing. 

He was saying it was just a joke and he was messing around everyone was on his side saying it wasn't a big deal. At first he said he wasn't getting out but then I said I was gunna snatch him out if he didn't. He finally did with no type of physical encouragement. He lived the furthest but I made him walk the rest of the way.

Everyone else was still mad at me. I dropped them all off and went on my way. I called the guy I kicked out to make sure he got home safe and told him to never say any shit like that around me ever again. He apologized but was still mad because he thought me making him walk was too far. AITA?
//
AITA for giving my child a "culturally inappropriate" name?
**
I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. 

Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like "What kinda name is Dimitri?", or "You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name." 

It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of "You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name."

So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?
//
AITA for telling my cousin that I would not make a blanket for her kid for free
**
So some context: I am a uni student and in my free time  I crochet a lot. 

I was spending a week at my grandma’s to help her wash the windows and do some cleaning. My cousin (31F) came for a visit and asked me to show her what I was working on. 
Currently, I am making a starburst granny-square blanket ([pattern](https://youtu.be/R3mbrXdoJns) for anyone interested) so I showed her the squares I’ve made so far and told her that it was to be my first king-sized blanket for my and my bfs first shared apartment (we will be moving in next year) 

She told me that in all that time I could make a second blanket and give this one to her daughter as a birthday present. 

I told her that I absolutely would not do that because it is hard work to make a blanket and also very expensive since I am using good quality yarn. 

I told her that I’d be happy to put my own project aside and make one for her kid as a commission, but that I wouldn’t do it for free as I couldn’t afford that 

My dad thinks that I should have asked them to cover the costs of the yarn and make a free blanket but I disagree considering how much work goes into a blanket


EDIT: The price for my work that I gave her is my family rate,  very symbolic costs + 1$/hour
//
AITA for allowing my terminally ill daughter to smoke and drink?
**
Hello, I am the (42) father to a 16 year old girl.

About 3 months ago we found out via a visit to the hospital that our daughter had a late stage form of brain cancer and were told that survival was not likely. We tried anyway, but despite our best efforts we found no improvement in the cancer. My daughter is aware of this.

Well, recently, my wife was looking for a hair straightener my daughter had borrowed and found a few grams of marijuana, an elf-bar vape, as well as a partially empty handle of Tito's Vodka in her bedroom. When confronted, my daughter confessed to have been using these substances for about a month at that point. She said that since she knew she wasn't likely going to survive past 18, she wanted to try these things socially, and assured us she was being responsible with them.

I myself am a user of these substances, as we live in a legal state. I do not vape, though I do smoke cigarettes, drink, and will occasionally roll myself a joint. While normally I would not want my children using these, I thought I could make an exception due to the circumstances. My wife, however, disagrees. She only drinks a glass of wine every now and then, and dislikes nicotine and marijuana.

We had a conversation and came to the conclusion that she would be allowed to do these things under my supervision, as long as they are from retail stores and dispensaries and not street dealers, though my wife remains adamant she should not be doing them at all.

AITA?
//
AITA for refusing to move out?
**
I 24F have lived in the same apartment for 4 years in this time I’ve had 2 roommates one the first two years I lived here and the second for the rest of the time. My current roommate 32F (V) has been great until now. She’s in a long term relationship and over Christmas she got proposed to. Now they want to live together but they both approached me and asked me to let her fiancé take over my lease and for me to find a new place as soon as possible. I have a few problems with this I feel like they should find a new place together because I’ve lived here longer. I also told V a few months ago that I spoke to the landlord about once our lease together is up that I’ll be living alone since I can now afford it. At that time she agreed and said that her and her boyfriend would look for a place together. I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fiancé and their friends harassing me about it. There’s 4 months left on the lease so I’m just going to ignore them but when I spoke to my mom about it she thinks I should let them have the apartment since they need to start saving for their wedding.
//
AITA for not apologising to my roommate’s girlfriend because she saw me naked?
**
Basically this. My roommate (21m) and I (20m) aren’t close friends but we live together because it’s convenient for both of us. He has a new girlfriend and lately she’s been staying over a lot. 

Our apartment has two bathrooms, I’m saying this because it’s relevant later, one is in my room and the other one is in the hall. I use the one in my bedroom and he uses the other one. 

Yesterday, I was just out of the shower and walking around in my room naked, trying to find clothes and other stuff cause I’m messy, when his girlfriend barges into my room without even knocking. I do generally lock my room, but it’s never been a big deal because my roommate never comes in w/o knocking. Also, I did not know this girl was in the house. I’d have made sure to lock the door then. Obviously she went like wtf and ran out. 

Then she was very cross with me, and seemed to think that I owed her an apology because she saw me naked and it made her very uncomfortable. I was nope, you walked into my room w/o knocking, what you see or didn’t see after that is NOT my fault. At all. Her explanation was that the other bathroom was busy and she just wanted to use the one in my bedroom. 

She’s involved roommate into this and he too thinks that I should apologise because I shouldn’t have been walking around in my room naked without locking the door first. I’ve refused to apologise. 

AITA?
//
AITA For laughing my ass off at my wife's expense?
**
Just for context, I am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. She is insecure about her height and while I try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she doesn't like about herself.

With this in mind, we recently went to one of my favorite places to eat. Now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. 
We ordered our food, and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said 'for your lovely daughter' to me.

I honestly couldn't help but burst out laughing to the point that I had tears in my eyes and I had to compose myself before driving back home. 

My wife was obviously pretty pissed. AITA?
//
AITA for not telling someone I can read lips
**
This happened pre COVID btw.

I've had hearing loss for most of my life , but it was diagnosed when I was about 7 years old. So I learned to read lips at the same time I was learning to speak. I'm very proficient in reading lips.

Whenever I work with someone new, I make sure to let them know that I have hearing loss and to make sure that they are facing me and I'm aware they're talkin to me.

I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.

A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. 

I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her. Once someone got my attention I apologize to her and pointed out that I did have hearing loss and I wasn't aware that she was talking to me.

A few days later she was venting to a mutual coworker. The only problem was she was facing me and I could read her lips perfectly. 

After a few minutes I approached her and let her know that if she was going to s*** talk someone she needed to make sure they couldn't understand her and that I was reading her lips the entire time.

I told her I was upset that she wouldn't just come to me, and that I did tell her twice that I was partially deaf and couldn't hear her. She freaked out because apparently I was being rude by reading her lips when she was facing me
//
WIBTA if I quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? I would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. Ex wife as well.
**
So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. 

For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

Kids would be cut off. I wouldn’t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they’d have to grow up and fast.

Would I be the asshole if I do this?
//
AITA for banning alcohol from Christmas.
**
My husbands family likes to drink. Every holiday includes multiple bottles of wine/cocktails. I hate drinking I have never drank my father was an alcoholic I think it’s childish if you can’t have fun without drinking.

This year I’m hosting Christmas for a change I decided since it’s at my house no alcohol allowed we are all getting older and it’s time to grow up.

My husbands sister called to ask what she could bring. She saw a recipe for a Christmas martini that she wanted to bring. I told her about my no alcohol rule. She didn’t say much but must have told the rest of the family. Some of them started texting me asking me if I was serious and saying that it is lame. But I’m not budging. 

Now it turns out my husbands sister is hosting an alternate gathering that almost everyone is choosing to go to instead. It’s so disrespectful all because they would have to spend one day sober. 

My husband told me he talked to his sister and we are invited to her gathering and he said we should just go and stop causing issues but I won’t it’s so rude. 

Now husband is mad because I’m making him stay home and spend Christmas with me but it was my turn to host and I chose to have a no alcohol they could have dealt with it for one year.
//
AITA for telling my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my inheritance?
**
My grandpa passed away a few months ago and I inherited a little over $4 million from his estate. I had no idea he had that much money and was honestly not expecting to receive anything, as I assumed it would all go to my mom. 

After I got over the initial shock, I took the opportunity to finally quit my job (which I really hated), as I don’t have any outstanding debts and can easily live off of $40,000 a year. I’m pretty introverted and am more than happy to stay at home working on art/music/other interests and gaming.

Ever since I inherited the money, my boyfriend has been pressuring me to cover all of the rent and utilities (about $1200 a month) for our apartment and start putting money away into a joint savings fund. I would be happy to do this if we were married, but we’re not. We’ve only been dating for a year and a half, and I would prefer to keep our finances separate. Despite not working anymore, I still pay my half of the rent every month and have started paying for a housekeeper to come in and clean a few times a week, so our apartment is nearly always spotless and looks great. 

I told my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my money and he said I was being selfish for expecting him to still contribute to the rent when I could easily afford to pay for the whole thing. AITA?
//
AITA for not letting my roommate wear something she stole from me?
**
Last night my roommate was about to leave for some fancy dinner she was attending at her boyfriend’s parent’s house and I noticed she was wearing my dress. I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn’t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don’t have that kind of relationship, we’re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I’m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?
//
AITA for calling out a secretary and threatening to report her to her manager after she revealed health information?
**
I got a needle stick injury at work (Im a healthcare worker) and my family doctor filled out a lab requisition for baseline bloodwork to be done. One of the tests is HIV.

I went to an external lab to get it done because my family MD office is closed. It’s a typical diagnostics lab. In the waiting area there are 5 other people sitting down.

I go to the secretary and hand her the req forms. She takes them, checks me in, and I sit down.

After 10 minutes she calls me back calling out my first name and says, “Ma’am there’s an issue with the HIV test form.”

EVERYBODY in the waiting area heard and gave me looks. I go up to her, very angry, I told her you cannot just announce people’s personal health information like that.

She says, “Oh its ok, you are getting tested just because of a workplace injury.” I told her that’s fine, but other people don’t know that. What if I had to get tested for HIV for a more personal reason? What if somebody who knew me was in the waiting area and heard I was getting tested? 

She apologized but I told her I will be calling her manager and informing them of the incident. She rolled her eyes and said “Go ahead.” in a mocking tone.

I told my husband what happened and he said maybe I should cut her some slack. But I told him, revealing personal health information is a huge violation. Its something that was drilled into me as a healthcare worker. I am appalled that the secretary was so blasé about it. I don’t care if she gets reprimanded or loses her job, this is not something to mess around with.

AITA for refusing to give this woman her grandma's wedding dress and jewelry back?
**
I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

Now she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?

AITA for filling a few faux Amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?
**
This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. There are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with dog shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said " Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. AITA or am I a diabolical genius?
//
AITA for being topless at home?
**
I have a son (4 months old), I'm breastfeeding, he's forever spitting up on me, and we're trying to give as much skin to skin contact as possible. Because of this, I've pretty much stopped wearing clothes at home. I'll wear them when I go out, obviously, but in the privacy of mine and my boyfriend's flat I just go bare chested. My in laws were meant to come by around 6pm, and instead came by over an hour early and let themselves in with the spare key. I was sleeping on the sofa with my son on my chest, they got an eyeful. I woke up to them yelling at me to put a shirt on and asking why I didn't do that sooner if I knew they'd be over today. I maintain that they were a full hour early and why on earth would they just let themselves in when I didn't answer the door. My boyfriend wants me to apologise, I refuse. Who's the arsehole here?

Edit: to everyone commenting about the sleeping situation as being a risk of suffocation/SIDS please know that I am fully aware of this and am taking all measures to avoid any injury/death of my child, this was a one off event after he fell asleep on top of me and we napped for less than an hour, probably closer to half an hour. I appreciate the concern but this is the only time it's happened and it won't be happening again.

&#x200B;

Update: I am aware of how the votes on here are shaping up but they are the only people I have close by rn. My boyfriend is mad at me for making things awkward, and my in laws are annoyed by what they saw, so I just called them and apologised. Going forward I will assume they will be early and not nap/be shirtless on days they are coming in case they arrive ahead of time.
//
AITA for refusing to train with a Nazi?
**
So I practice BJJ for a couple of years, mostly attendings classes that require a Gi. This means that our bodies are pretty much covered (this is important).

A new dude has joined our gym recently - I saw him in a class but did not roll with him. Last week I attended a no Gi class and the coach pairs me up with new guy. New guy wears a sleeveless rash guard, lots of tattoos on both arms and legs. I look at this tattoos and there is a big black swastika on his arm. As I take a closer look there is also the SS symbol - the one that looks like thunder bolts. Some other symbols here and there as well like the Celtic Cross.

I tell my coach that I want to be paired up with someone else. Coach finds me a new partner but after the class asks me what is wrong. I tell him that the guy has lots of Nazi tattoos and I don't roll with Nazis. Now the coach is mad at me for bringing politics into the gym. 

I told my coach that he is bringing politics into the gym by allowing a guy to walk around with a swastika on his arm. Some guys from the class are behind me, some think I am making a big deal out of it 

AITA for refusing to roll with a Nazi?

Edit for clarification: Not in the USA. Where I come from (Europe) there are still Nazi sympathisers - a minority but a vocal minority. Also you can easily roll with a long sleeved rash guard, the climate here allows it no need for no sleeves.

AITA I got mad at my wife because she caused me to fail an important interview
**
I(27M) and my wife(24F) have been married for 3 years. She is 6 months pregnant. 

I have been looking for a job with a better pay since my wife said that she wanted to be a SAHM after the birth. 

Today, I had this interview for a position at a very good IT company which would be paying triple my current salary. 

There were a lot of measures taken to prevent malpractice. I was not allowed to look anywhere but the screen, etc. The test was conducted on an online platform. 

I had told her numerous times before the exam about the strict invigilation. 

Just 15 minutes after the test started, my wife started knocking on my study door and calling out my name saying she wanted me to open a jar. I ignored her because I would be disqualified from the interview if I looked anywhere else or spoke...  I figured she'd get the hint that I couldn't talk. But she didn't she yelled at me calling me an AH and went on to talk to her friends on call. It didn't stop at the calls, she played loud music for her online dance yoga class. It was extremely distracting and I made a lot of mistakes in the exam

It was a multiple choice questions based test so I got the results immediately and as expected I had miserably failed it. 

I was livid at my wife. This was the 5th interview that she ruined like this. I told her that I give up on trying to make her life easier and that I'm not ready to go looking for any more jobs since she doesn't even want to maintain silence during important interviews. I told her to start working again after the birth and that I am ok paying for a nanny/babysitter. 

She said that in being unreasonable in expecting perfect silence at home. 

AITA?

AITA for refusing to to let my husband's infertile friend name our son?
**


My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby.


A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a "done deal". I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused.


AITA for choosing this hill to die on?
//
AITA for telling my family to stop celebrating?
**
6 years ago I met the best person in the world. She was a sweet old lady that moved in next door, named Maggie. Maggie taught me how to knit, we watch Mamas family together, i helped her give her cat her medicine, I helped water her plants when she got to frail to do it herself. She knitted me a hat for every holiday., I helped her install WiFi. Maggie was a nurse in WWII.

Maggie passed away 3 months ago at the age of 94. She went peacefully in her sleep, and it is the heartbreak of my life. About two weeks after she died, I noticed a man walking into Maggie’s house. Maggie didn’t have any family except for a nephew, who lived across the country. I went up to him and asked who he was, and he said he was going to clean out his aunts things.

That was the end of that until yesterday. Maggie’s nephew had rung my doorbell, and had told me that Maggie left me most everything she had in her will. Maggie left me 1 million dollars in a account I can open when I turn 18, most of her personal effects, and her cat, blue. Who I rescued two days after she died and kept. She wrote me and her nephew letters. she said some stuff I would rather not share. It tore me up about Maggie even more. She was such a gentle soul and she deserved better. 

I started crying, and I told my parents. They started celebrating about  it immediately. I asked them to stop. And they did, until today they presented me with a cake, that said “hey, you get to go to college!”. To say that it made me upset is a understatement. I get that Maggie’s money is a life changing thing, but I would much rather have Maggie. 

I told them to stop celebrating then I went to my room to hold blue and cry. My brother knocked on my door and told me I was being a asshole because our parents are just happy for me. 

AITA?
//
AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?
**
I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

So this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.
//
AITA for calling out step-family’s dirty laundry at Thanksgiving after they criticized me for being unmarried?
**
I’m still getting shit for this from my family so it’s possible I may be a bit of the AH here.

I’m 29F, the players are my mom, step-dad, and four step-siblings (35M, 37M, 40F, 42M) and their families.  I’m the black sheep in that I’m the only one not married with kids, but that’s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don’t want kids, and having a partner just isn’t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I’m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been “ew, never”.

I was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I’m not anxious to have kids since I’m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said “Nah, I’m good.”  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn’t appreciate. I said let’s move on, but my mom said “We’re just worried about you.”

This is where I’m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, “Well, I’m the only person at this table that’s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I’m not the one to worry about.”

And that’s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.

I feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.
//
AITA for telling my to be granddaughter in law some lewd advice after my family asked for some ‘grandmotherly wisdom’?
**
My good friend Gracie made me aware a few weeks ago of a phrase that made both of us laugh til we were sore, a dirty phrase which is ‘the key to a successful marriage is to keep a mans stomach full and balls empty’. 

Both of us are in our 70’s and jovial and sprightly if I may say so. I liked the phrase – it was funny, and it stuck around in my mind. My family are aware I have a filthy sense of humor and I do like to laugh. 

My eldest grandson is in his 30’s and recently proposed to his fiancée, they made us aware over it via a family FaceTime session. It was very sweet and everyone was in good spirits, drinking, etc. 

My granddaughter and daughter pushed me to say a few words in the way of advice, but frankly I wouldn’t know, and I’m not one to give advice anyway. my grandsons fiancée said no no, give us some wisdom! So I said the phrase and the only people who burst out laughing were my grandson and his fiancée. 

Everyone else looked mortified and my granddaughter immediately started berating me. I told my friends this and they think it wasn’t a big deal but my granddaughter and daughter have texted to say I was inappropriate and ruined a moment.

WIBTA if I refused to help with my partner's daughter's grad party after I've been banned from attending?
**
My long-time partner has been divorced for years. The divorce was acrimonious and he and his ex-wife do not get along. We've been asked to host their daughter's graduation party at our home because my partner's ex dropped the ball and failed to secure the venue. I spent a week planning the party, making arrangements, and ordering materials to make her vision a reality. A week later, she informed us that my presence would anger her mother, and under no circumstances could I attend the party being held at my home (in our shop). I am expected, however; to devote my time and creative talents to making her graduation party beautiful. WIBTA if I refused to plan, organize and decorate for this party?

UPDATE: In our home, next door to this boring party, all of my best girlfriends and I will be consuming the food I had planned for the party, while dressed in LBDs, drinking champagne, and contemplating my future.

AITA FOR NOT GIVING MY COUSIN MY GRANDMOTHER’s HOUSE AFTER SHE PASSED
**
I’m a 27 year old male and my grandmother passed recently. In her will she left me her 4 bedroom 2 bath house. Now before my grandmother passed she was in danger of losing the house because of unpaid taxes. She asked various family members for help but none did. I was in college at the time and I had a huge student refund. 

She asked me for $1,500 to settle the debt. She said thank you and we never talked about it again. I didn’t want my granny to be homeless after all. That was about 8 years ago. Fast forward to today and I’m now the owner of a house in the heart of Atlanta. Prime real estate If I do say so myself. I plan on moving in at the end of the month before doing some light cleaning and renovation. Enter my cousin and her kids. 

She is upset with me because I got the house. She said because I don’t have any kids I should give her the house because I’m her eyes I got the house for free. I thought she was crazy but a lot of our family is on her side. Stating that it’s hard out here for a single mother. They told me I can buy a house one day because I am a able bodied young man. It will be harder for her because she has two kids. I’m like she chose to have those kids and that isn’t my problem. Everyone is calling me selfish and hell maybe I am but my grandmother wanted me to have the house. I’m I the Asshole

AITA for wanting to tell my brother's fiancée about the tracking app he secretly installed in the new phone he bought for her?
**


Pretty much the title, My f22 brother m27 is currently engaged to his fiancèe f25. he bought he a new phone for valentine's and asked my boyfriend who's trained in computer and software to install a hidden tracking app on the phone so his fianceè won't see it or notice. I overheard them talking and when I entered the room they went silent. I waited til my brother left then talked to my boyfriend, he denied having this conversation with my brother first then, admitted to installing the app on the phone. I told him he and my brother were in the wrong because this is huge breach of privacy. he said he has nothing to do with it and advised me to stay out of it as well. but I said I want to tell my brother's fiancèe. my boyfriend argued with me about being nosy and intrusive and told me to stay out of it and let them deal with their own issues. But I thought that was unfair to my future sister in law since she's the one working, paying bills and rent and this is how she is treated? My boyfriend told me gtfo with this attitude and again, said I should stay of it because it does not in any way concern me. I don't know I feel horrible after hearing about what my brother did and since I have a good relationship with his fiancee I can't help but feel guilty and wanting to tell her.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i683wb/aita_for_saying_that_my_daughters_best_friend_has/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

First of all I want to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and I apologize I couldn’t respond or post an update earlier. 

We went to the doctor, he has been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I won’t go much into detail.It was really hard for everyone but he’s getting the help he needs now, he goes to physical/mental therapy and he’s slowly getting better. I’m paying for everything and money is not the problem either. He’s still staying with me, I talk to their parents regularly and they approve of everything, they’re pretty thankful. My daughter apologized for thinking I was the asshole for getting him help. 

He knows we’re there for him and hopefully he’ll fully recover soon, thank you again for judgment and good wishes :)
//
AITA for leaving the restaurant after my bf refused to pay for my meal?
**
I had lent my bf some money few weeks ago because of something he needed and he promised to pay me back asap.

He was supposed to pay me back 5 days ago but something came up and he didn't. I tried to be patient.

Yesterday we had planned to go out with some friends at night for dinner. Yesterday after I came back from work I was robbed in the bus and I had all my money and cards stolen. I cancelled my cards but the bank customer service  told me my new card with my new details (both physical card and the digital details for apple pay) would be available the following morning because the banks were closed that afternoon. So I had no money.

When we went to dinner with my bf and friends I told my bf if he could just pay me back the money or at least pay for my meal since I have no money. He didn't exactly say yes or no, just a simple "don't worry". As we ordered he only ordered for himself and told me that he can't cover for mine at the moment so I better not order anything and just have some bites from his meal.

I was so mad and frustrated because he had promised to give me back the money, he then claimed something came up and couldn't give them back but then ordered a nice meal for himself and just told me to get his scraps because he wouldn't pay me back or at least for my meal. I'd be the only one sitting there with no meal in front of me. I said this is ridiculous and I got up and left.

Our friends now believe it was very low of me to get up and leave and how I should just be polite and stay there. I can't quite understand that logic but is there any way I am TA?
//
AITA for asking my friend for a “boob-voyage” party?
**
A while ago, my doctor found a cancerous lump in my breast. Thankfully it was stage 1, but I did end up having a mastectomy. It was a stressful time, and when my friend was over a few days before my surgery, we got on the topic of the “boob-voyage” party from Jane the virgin. I asked her if she would throw me one of those parties to help me get my mind off it. 

I thought she would put together just a small girls night, but she went all out. She invited all of my friends and my boyfriend and had an array of boob paraphernalia. It was funny and lighthearted and meant a lot to me to get all that support from my friends.

During my recovery, my boyfriend confronted me and said that he hated the boob party, he thought it was tacky, and he was offended that I hadn’t asked him to put something together instead. He said that we were supposed to be going through it together and I should have thought about his feelings and the fact that he doesn’t like parties and wouldn’t want to spend one of the nights leading up to my surgery like that. I told him that I’m sorry he felt that way, but it was really helpful for me and I was the one getting surgery and treatment. I told him I wanted to support him but my feelings had to take priority under those particular circumstances and the party helped me. He’s still angry at me for refusing to apologize for asking my friend to throw the party without asking how he felt about it first. It comes up now and again and he still wants me to apologize. AITA?
//
AITA for ruining jeans for women?
**
I work at an office where I’m allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the “no jeans policy.” She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

Problem is, for the past few months that I’ve been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. 

I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

I said “Well, the girls get to wear jeans.”

“No they don’t.”

Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn’t allowed to wear jeans. 

In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn’t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

AITA?

EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can’t say I’m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn’t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!

AITA for laughing hysterically after my husband called me "housewife" and embarrasing him infront of coworkers?
**


My husband invited his new coworkers over for dinner. When they arrived he introduced me by gesturing at me and saying "this is mrs Smith (didn't even say my name)...the housewife!".

I looked at him for a second then I started laughing hysterically. I then told said "no honey I work full time and YES I still act like a housewife when I'm home because you simply can't bother to help". His co workers were staring at him as he tried to laugh and change the subject and ask what they wanted to drink.

Dinner went super awkward with him giving me looks and stares. Once the guests left he blew up saying I embarrassed him by laughing like a lunatic and then making the comment I made infront of his new coworks and ruining his image. I told him he was wrong to lie about my status and deny my degree to begin with. He said I could've talked to him about it privately later but not like this, and making his coworkers think he's useless.

He stormed off and has been quiet the entire night.

UPDATE: AITA for not adhering to the wedding dress code
**
So I posted about a month ago about my sister requesting I wear a long sleeve ankle length black dress to her lakeside wedding in summer, while being 9 months pregnant and I’ve gotten many requests to update 


Well, I ended up having my baby like 3 days after making the post so I was in the hospital when the wedding happened, so I didn’t go. My sister was there when I pushed her out and apologized for being a bridezilla so all is well and I have a cute baby.

Sorry that this was an anticlimactic update but I give the people what they want.



ETA: sorry guys no baby tax. I’m not comfortable posting photos on a public forum, especially with some creeps and assholes on here.

Wow I’m an idiot I should absolutely update what happened at the wedding sorry I got that mommy brain

She still wanted everyone to wear black, but she did go lax on style. So like, kind of a redemption arc? The photos look nice, if not a little dreary. She thought black would make things look classy. She looked beautiful tho so mission accomplished.

AITA for telling my girlfriend’s friend to watch her mouth when she insinuated that my girlfriend isn’t a real woman?
**
I went on a dinner double date with my girlfriend, my girlfriend’s friend Amy, and Amy’s boyfriend. We’re all in our early 20s. My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I’ve never cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. 


Dinner was going alright until Amy’s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entrée. After that, Amy, who isn’t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn’t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. 


I loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary. Amy isn’t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. 


My girlfriend and Amy’s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy’s boyfriend to get up and leave with her. Don’t worry, you pay before you get your food at this restaurant. 


My girlfriend and I talked about Amy. She kept saying that Amy and some of her friends make those comments all the time and they don’t mean them to be derogatory. I tried to convince my girlfriend that no friend would make those types of comments and she’s better off without someone like Amy in her life. 


My girlfriend still thinks that Amy didn’t mean to hurt her with the “real woman” and “Barbie doll” comments and I didn’t read the room correctly. She told me she feared Amy not wanting to be friends with her anymore after my creating a rift between them. I couldn’t get though to her no matter how much I tried.

AITA for making my step sister seem "uneducated"?
**
Hi. So, i (f21) am currently staying with my family on my dad's side. My step sister is 19. We never got along. I grew up in Korea and have a Korean name. I won't say it here but it's the same as a Blackpink member, not too hard to pronounce specially after 7 years of being my step sister but she always gets it wrong to a point that it seems on purpose. 
The rest of the family gets it right, except for my little sister but she is 3 lol

I speak 5 languages in total, my step brother speaks 3, my step sister never wanted to learn even thought she had the chance.

Anyway i am TIRED of her never getting my name right. We were in a small reunion yesterday (all safe) and she kept misspronouncing it.

At one point i misspronounced a word and my sister made fun of it in front of everyone, making everyone laugh at me. I was tired, i wasn't feeling well and wanted to just go home. I told her that i was sorry about misspronouncing a word in one of the 5 languages i speak while she only speaks English and can't ever get a Korean name right.

My step mom was FURIOUS and oh god if there was trouble when i got home. Everyone is mad at me for making my step sis seem uneducated in public.

Am i the asshole?

Edit to add: She has no speech impediment, i gave her the option of going by my initial and her mom, the woman that almost let me die when i was 15 gets my name right.

META At any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.
**
This seems like a really weird meta post, but I just wanted to warn people that Captain Sparklez, a YouTuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole Trails episode talking about this sub. It's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

It seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. The thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to "get out" is actually incredibly scary to me.

This isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. Honestly I knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds I know to this day. But it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. Take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

I *am* the asshole, I already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. Sorry, teenagers, but I kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. I wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but I would also be looking at their advice differently if I knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Just be careful everyone. And please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. This doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind "sub dedicated to helping others" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than "sub dedicated to calling other people assholes." I just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.

AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?
**
My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. 


My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?


Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.
//
AITA for telling my step-mom that she can use the missing child-support payments to fund my part of my dad's gift?
**
Sorry for the wordy title, my (18M) dad left my mom when I was 6 (not because of my step-mom), four years ago he met and married my SM Aida, she had 3 kids from a previous marriage that my dad loved to parent instead of me, after they got together I saw him, at best, 7-8 times every year because they moved 5 hour away. A year later he had ''a change of heart'' and demanded his 50/50 custody, which made me miserable, he built a room for me at his new house, tried to fill the missing years with new gifts, even planned a big birthday party for my 12th birthday, at 13, I stopped going to his place. 

For me, he wasn't my dad. After he left, mom's brother (who was only 25 at the time) took me in as one of his boys, mom and I moved back to  my grandparents place and my uncle lived next door, he already had a kid, and he was always there for me, he's my father while my aunt is like a second mother for me and my cousin is like the brother I never had. When I stopped going to my bio-dad's my mom had to get a second job so I used to sleep at my uncle's pretty much every day, I didn't understand why until last year, when my grandma told me my dad had stopped paying child support out of spite and my mom didn't had the money to take him to court. 

Ever since I turned 15, father's day is about my uncle for me, my cousin and I make him breakfast and plan a fun day with him with a small gift, now that I'm 18, my step-mom sent me a fb message saying that I'm old enough to give my part for my bio-dad's gift, this year, his step-kids wants to give him a car and that I should put 10% (like 1,800 to 2,100). I just sent her a lol meme and said she could use my missing child support to cover it. She blocked me and later on one of her kids sent me an AH message.

AITA for not inviting my kid's whole class to his birthday party?
**
I(28F) am a mother of a wonderful 8 years old son. This whole thing happened last April, but I am still getting complaints. So here I am asking strangers for a judgement on the internet.

So last year was my kid's first year in "big kids' school" like he calls it, since his first grade coincided with the pandemic. We are not in the best place financially; like most families, our consumer debt piled on and we are throwing every spare cent at it.

So when it was time to throw him a party, I only invited 5 of his classmates, the ones he considered his friends. For the others I sent 2 dozen cupcakes and juice boxes to class.

The invites were delivered to their houses and not in front of the other kids.

Like I said, money was tight so I got creative. I made 9 small cakes (box cakes, vanilla, chocolate and funfetti), buttercream in different colours. Also made big sugar cookies and different coloured frosting and sprinkles. And finally bought tortillas, made pizza sauce and had a variety of toppings. I asked that the kids bring swimsuits and water guns.

We had a make your own pizza station for lunch, then they played with their water guns. Then they decorated their cakes and finally their cookies to take home with them. That was a Saturday.

Well the next Monday, the kids would not stop raving about how fun the party was, how it was the best birthday party ever. The other kids were not happy to not be invited.

At pick up Tuesday, a couple moms confronted me about not inviting their kids. I said that I am sorry, but it was a small party for his close friends only. They kept complaining about me excluding their kids.

I didn't take it seriously then, but now it is a new school year, almost 6 month later, and I am still getting the occasional comment thrown at me. So AITA?
//
AITA for inviting my (29M) Girlfriend (28F) on an expensive vacation and expecting her to pay all of her share? (I make a lot more than her)
**
Hello. My girlfriend, myself, my parents, and my brother and his wife all went on vacation in another country a week ago. My brother and I were the ones who did most of the planning of the itinerary although we did ask everyone else for input. For background, I make around $150,000k as an IT consultant, my girlfriend is a teacher making $45,000k. My parents are pretty affluent as well as my brother and sister in law.

My girlfriend knew this trip was coming up and took on a second job waitressing on the weekends for several months to get ready for it. We have always split things 50/50 in the 2 years we have been together. There were a few times on the vacation when she did not go on outings with us- wine tasting/scuba diving/etc. She also would only eat 2 meals a day, simply stating that she was on a budget. My family does favor more high-end (\*expensive\*) places. My parents thought it was very strange that she only eats 2 meals a day although normally she eats 3. 

When we got home I asked her why she skipped out on several of the outings and only ate 2 meals a day- I mentioned how I heard her stomach growling one night and said I was concerned about her having an eating disorder. She got teary eyed and said that 3 meals a day wasn't fiscally feasible for her and neither were the outings that she chose not to go on (she went on 3 of 6 outings). She said she was not expecting everything to cost so much and she was overwhelmed. 

She also said she doesn't know if this is going to work long term if she is expected to go on vacations like that with people who make so much more than her. I feel bad that I did not pick up on her discomfort sooner. But we did agree to split everything 50/50 and I don't know why she agreed to come if the cost was an issue.

Update: WIBTA for sending neighbor a cease and desist letter?

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i3rv2v/wibta_for_sending_neighbor_a_cease_and_desist/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

It's a very happy update!

I drafted the letter with some legal assistance. Prior to sending it, I wanted to ensure I had proper cameras in the event he decided to make things worse. When I installed the camera, the neighbor must have realized why it was installed because they stopped doing all the annoying stuff.

Then, about a month later, they listed their house for sale. They've moved out and we don't have to deal with their entitled asshole attitude anymore!

I appreciate all the assistance and support as I was really unsure if I was going in the right direction.

Edit: I want to clarify. I do not believe that the neighbor moved because of anything I did or asked him to stop doing. I think he had been planning to move for some time and was just an absolute dick of a person. They didn't move because of me, and even if they did, they sold the house for $200,000 more than they bought it 3 years ago. So he is not some victim.

I do appreciate all the kind words. I am also bummed that so many people have shitty neighbors as well.

AITA for telling people my sister had an abortion.
**
I'm 99% sure I'm a megga asshole but I came here to just be sure. 

my sister 23f is a megga pro life advocate, here is the stupid part, I held her hand a year ago when she got her abortion. she never mentions it and I can guarantee that I'm the only one who knew. 

I always feel like she is being super hypocritical because she got an easy access to have an abortion and then wants to take that away from others. 

I was getting sick of seeing her abortion kills babys posts and how she hates pro choice people so I decided to comment on one of her posts. I commented, you where definitely pro life when I held your had last year at the abortion clinic. 

I've now been blocked and she was banned from most of her pro life fb groups.

AITA for 'going off' on a mother in the toy store
**
I'm (28M) my brothers care taker (21M mental age 7-8), our parents decided at 18 to tell us to screw off, so when my brother (let's call him Bill) turned 18 I grabbed him and enrolled him to get his GED since he didn't finish highschool, and take care of him. His chores are too clean his room,  help with laundry and set the table for supper. I get paid by the state and you better believe I make sure his needs are met. He's my little bud. 

At the end of the month for each day he does his chores he gets a sticker, at the end of the month that sticker gets counted as 5$ and he uses the money for whatever he wants.  Like toys, special snacks etc. He loves this. 

He's been so good lately with chores I took him out for burgers and fries and took him to the toy store. My brother is big.  Not fat, just tall and actually big boned (he's healthy weight and overall health), he gets excited and stims by flapping his hands, you do you little dude. 

At the toystore he announced he wants Barbie's,  cool,  no judgement,  and we go look at barbies. He's stimming and rambling about what he wanted and meanwhile a lady and little girl come in the aisle. Not even two minutes pass and the lady tells us to go to another aisle, she wants to look at the dolls and his weird hand movements are freaking her out.  I tell her to wait her turn. 

Not even another minute passes and she tells my brother to knock it off and go look at something else. Now I'm pissed. I tell my brother to get what he wants and looked at her and told her, her daughter could use a better role model, I'd hate for her to turn into such a grouchy hag. Took my brother out to pay for his barbies all while ignoring her telling me how much of an asshole I am for saying that in front of her daughter.

AITA for refusing to be in my father's wedding even tho I "cheated too"?
**
A story as old as time. My (f27) father (50) cheated on my mother for 5 years with a younger woman(currently 32) and he left my mother when mistress got pregnant. It tore our family apart.

I resent my father because my mother actually loved him and she is still dealing with this. Even 1 year after he left her.
I stayed on okay terms with him because I was the one to pick up and drop off my younger brother at his place.

Last week when I picked up my brother my father had big news. He proposed to his girlfriend and wanted me as his best (wo)man. It made me kinda mad ngl. But I kept calm... And told him no. He said that what happened between him and mom was none of our business and that I should respect his new relationship. I said I respect it but that doesn't mean I condone it. Obviously I would never hound him randomly about it but I don't approve of it and I don't like her. She knew the whole time my mom and we existed .

Well my dad was having none of it and told me to get off my high horse because I had cheated too and I had no right.
And I.... Guess?
When I was 17 I was with this boy for 3 months. I went to a party got shit faced and made out with a classmate for a total of 10 minutes. I felt so bad that I called my boyfriend crying and we talked it out. We broke up. I told my dad and In 10 years I never did something like that again. I have been with my partner for 5 years.
I told him he could not equate it at all. He called me a hypocrite. And that he was glad to know who I am.

Driving home I felt like I was a bit harsh. He is still my father and he is not a bad father. I just don't want to be in his wedding. I would still go. But AITA,?

AITA for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?
**
When my wife \[32F\] and I \[32M\] got married eighht years ago, she made about 15K more per year than I did. Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.

&#x200B;

A few years after we married I decided to go to law school. Long story short, I ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. Since I managed not to go into debt, I have a good bit of money left over after I make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200B;

My wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that I get to buy most of the things I want while she is on a much more limited budget), and I told her I would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. I think fair is fair since this was her idea, but I do wonder if  I am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

AITA for tipping our waitress 20 dollars despite her poor service, because my date was playing a "game" with her tips?
**
I met a guy on a dating app, we hit it off and we arranged for our first date. Things were going well, we had sat down and had started some small chat. Our waitress comes over asking us what we want to order.

I say what I want and gesture to him so he can order. He orders and then pulls what I think is about 15 dollars on the table. He says "This is your tip. Everytime you mess up, I take some away".

The waitress looked nervous immediately. I'm sitting there a bit shocked, but mostly embarrassed because I wasn't expecting this. She must have been new as well, because she did spill some drinks on our table that night, gave us the wrong food, and overall just seemed lost. He took away 13 dollars. 

I asked him why he thought doing tips this way was a good idea. He said it was the best way to ensure "good service". When I disagreed he said "Cant always be nice to these people, it's not a respectable job".

I decided then that I wanted nothing to do with him, and called the waitress over to get the bill. I slapped a 20 dollar bill in her hand and got up to pay for my own meal. 

Later that night he had demanded to know why I had given her the tip despite her poor service and I told him it's because he decided to treat her livelihood like it was a game. He said because of me she'll never improve her service and that I'm just a people pleaser. 

I blocked him, but I've wondered ever since if that was really the right thing to do.

AITA for making my father re-book my wedding venue at nearly triple the original cost after my stepsister cancelled my original booking?
**
My stepsister impersonated me and cancelled my wedding venue reservation. She's 18 and a jealous cow.

I got the reservation for a steal because I booked early and covid made things uncertain. 

Well now demand for wedding venues has skyrocketed. The venue is now asking nearly triple the original cost for the same date.

They said they'll only honor the original reservation if I show proof that my stepsister committed fraud/identity theft in the form of a police report.

My father has begged me not to involve the police. So I told him he'll need to cover the new cost then. All of it except my original deposit. Because I'm aggravated as fuck.

He's going to be selling some property in order to do this. He has put down the additional deposit for the venue already though.

I know he was not to blame but he houses that witch and by asking me not report her fraud ass, I can only assume he takes responsibility for her actions.

Am I the asshole? I do feel guilty because my fiance and I are much more financially well off than my father. But I just feel like this is not my problem to fix. He did find an alternative venue that was pretty nice and wasn't as expensive but I said it had to be the original venue. I'm just incredibly pissed off.
//
AITA for refusing to split rent with my boyfriend?
**
I (F23) have been dating my boyfriend “Jake” (M23) since our freshmen year of college. In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago). 

My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now? 

Our rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college. 

Is the idea that my DAD doesn’t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it?

EDIT: Jake and I still split utilities and groceries 50/50, and when we go out on date nights, we switch off who pays for it. If he pays one week, i’ll pay the next.

AITA for telling my husband he exaggerated when he said my kids ruined his daughter's birthday?
**

Last week was my stepdaughter's (SD) 14th birthday. She was in the hospital days prior for a medical issue and now she's better. My husband threw her a small birthday party.


Unbeknowest to me, my boys (16) & (12) decided to pull a funny prank and mess with the birthday cake that they made for her. Instead of adding icing on the cake, they added mayonnaise. It didn't go well and my SD's reaction was to cry. My husband blew up at the boys for what they did but they said they were just trying to prank her since it's the norm and they always prank each others. My husband said it was the wrong time to do this on her birthday especially after getting out of the hospital. He told the boys they ruined her birthday but I told him he exaggarated with this statement. He got upset and yelled at me for defending this behavior and being an enbler. I don't I am because the boys love her that's why they act like this but my husband was having non of it.


Both he and SD aren't speaking to me nor the boys. AITA for saying he exaggarated?

Update: AITA for not wanting to give any money to my pregnant ex?

You can read my original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lursho/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_any_money_to_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Hasn’t been that long but thought I should update since many of you wanted to know.
Following what a few here suggested I tried talking to my ex again about getting the prenatal paternity test done right now since she kept pressing me about giving her money. 

I said if her situation is that bad then let’s have this test done already so if the baby is mine I can start helping *now.* 

Because if we waited until after birth she was going to have to wait for my support until the results came in. Plus if she still refused a paternity test then, it would be more waiting around to get a court ordered test.

Meaning no help from me at all for a while even after the baby is already here. So yeah she agreed to it in the end.

He’s not mine. I just got the results day before yesterday. My ex didn’t really have much to say. She only txted “fine then I wont bother you anymore.” 

I told her I was sorry and wished her luck. Also told her about what u guys commented about Facebook posts selling or giving away used baby stuff, plus the WIC program that could help her out since she’s low income. But she didn’t respond after that and haven’t heard from her since so I don’t know if she’ll look into those. 

Not gonna lie I’m a little disappointed. I know I was having my doubts about this baby being mine and was keeping my distance. But like I said, I was mentally and physically preparing incase he was so that I could be there as a father. Still feel that loss but at least now I know for sure. 

I appreciate everyone who commented and thanks for the info and advice.

AITA for charging my sister £2500 for one of my paintings after her kid ruined it?
**
Backstory, I’m 26 and a fairly successful artist. My sister, “Lucy” (24) and her child “Ethan” (9) were at my house during a late New Years celebration. I had a sign posted on my art studio saying “DO NOT ENTER” and specifically made it clear to all guests that nobody was to enter that room. 
I’d also like to note that all my guests were asked to leave their kids at home as this was for ADULTS but ‘Lucy’ couldn’t do that because she couldn’t find a sitter. Anyway. 

Note : I also set up my boyfriends PS4 for him to play on so he wouldn’t be bored. 

It’s 10pm, and I hear a loud crash from my studio, I run up and see paint all over my recently work that so far had taken 15 hours to do. Ethan was sat there laughing, rubbing paint into my work, it’s now unsalvageable and I have to restart the work, as it was a specific request from a client. Which also puts me behind for the rest of my work now!! 

I immediately asked Ethan and Lucy to leave, and the next day I sent her a bill for the work. £2500 (which is LOWER than I would’ve gotten for the work anyway). 

She’s absolutely screaming about it, the whole family is divided. My mom hates me, my dad completely agrees with me. Surprise, my dad is an artist, my mum is more ‘smart smart’.  My sisters husband agrees with me. 
 
I will admittedly say, I don’t enjoy kids. Or their company. But I’ve always been a great auntie, presents at Christmas, gifts from vacation, everything he’s wanted. 

Am I the asshole for charging my sister £2500?

WIBTA if I refuse to go to my sister's wedding because I can't bring my girlfriend as my +1?
**
I'm a lesbian, and I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now.

My family, including my sister, is all fine with me being gay and supportive of my relationship. However, her fiancé comes from a very regressive and religious family, and while he himself is fine, his extended family is very traditional and anti-gay.

My sister gave me my invitation in person instead of mailing it, and explained that I wasn't getting a +1 because having a gay couple at the wedding would likely end up causing lots of drama with his side of the family. All my other siblings have +1s and are welcome to bring their (hetero) partners.

I understand where she's coming from, but it still feels like such a slap in the face. I'm not going to try and force her to give me a +1, but I'm seriously considering not going. I love my sister, but I'm not comfortable spending a whole day alone, while my other siblings are allowed to bring their partners, just because my sister wants to cater to a bunch of bigots.

I haven't said anything to anyone yet, but if I so stay home, would I be the asshole?

WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?
**
My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care. 

I’m in Australia, and I’m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

AITA? I found out my sister is pretending to be my daughter's mother
**
When my (27F) fiancé and I first announced my pregnancy to my family, my sister (34F) was a little jealous, I'm assuming it's because she was trying for a baby with her ex partner but they broke up because he was a cheat. 

I gave birth to my daughter seven months ago. Her name is Kaia. When I returned to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, my sister offered to babysit Kaia once a week which has been incredibly helpful. 

Not too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a "selfish b!tch" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written "mother and daughter." I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.

My mind is an absolute mess. I don't know where we go from here. AITA for how I handled the situation?

AITA for refusing to let a woman take for from my green house and pressing charges
**
I (30M) live in a nice little neighborhood, everyone knows everybody, we all have our own space and many have flower gardens.  I have a green house in my backyard that is visible from the street and behind a four foot picket fence. 

We got a new neighbor, haven't had the chance to meet them until today.  I have a camera in my yard that notified me of movement near the green house so I went and checked and that's when I found a lady and young teen picking tomatoes and peppers in my green house.  I raised my voice and asked what on earth they were doing and the woman says it's fine she's friends with the owner. 

I asked if she wants to run that by me again cause in the owner and I don't know who the hell they are.  When she realized she was caught she tried to leave with a bag  full of vegetables,  I told her she isn't leaving with that food and she has two minutes to drop it and leave or I'm pressing charges. 

She starts crying that she's trying to feed her child and needs it and that she can't afford this on her record but I didn't feel like rewarding a theft  and took the food from her and called the cops. She's telling everyone im an asshole and a toxic  man and though most are telling her she's in the wrong, her friends on facebook are telling me I'm an asshole and should be ashamed. 

AITA?

Edited for information: when she was offered the chance to leave without police involvement she screamed at me and broke a pot that had some chives growing. 

I don't have her on facebook. However my name is on my mail box and have since put my account to private. If she had asked first,  by all means I would have given her a couple peppers,  tomatoes even some squash,  but she didn't.

AITA for "forcing" my husband to sleep on the couch.
**



This conflict is pretty recent. I (f29) used to use tampons for my periods but due to medical reasons couldn't do it anymore. now I'm using pads which isn't that big of a deal but my husband disagrees. He firstly complained about me not "consulting" him first but like I said it's not a huge deal like BC. He then said he doesn't feel comfortable with me sleeping in bed wearing pads. this threw me off hard because I wasn't expecting him to have an issue on that regard, but he said it just doesn't feel comfortable *for him* and he would like me to use tampons at nighttime or sleep somewhere else. I laughed him off and kept sleeping on the bed while wearing my pads like there was no issue. This made him so uncomfortable he basically took the couch then started complaining about how I forced him on the couch by making him uncomfortable after he already offered me compromises. but I told him he was being a drama queen because his compromises are illogical, I wouldn't stop using pads and free bleed on the bed nor risk my health and use tampons when the doctor advised again them. he's still upset with me even though I'm no longer on my period saying I owe him for making him uncomfortable and brushing off his complaints.

AITA for getting my interviewer fired?
**
I (f27) went to a job interview for a potential job opportunity at this company. The interviewer, we'll call him "Eddie" (30ish) welcomed me into the office and had me sit down. First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was "real" or just 'lenses", also asked about how I spend my time when "alone" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying "keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an "attitude". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.

I went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I "ruined" it for myself and cost him his job.

AITA for not punishing my child after he corrected the teacher?
**
My 10 year old son had to watch some snoopy cartoon in class during which woodstock eats a roast turkey. The teacher told the class that this is fictional, and that birds don't eat other birds. My son corrected her and said something along the lines of "my uncle trains falcons to hunt other birds at the airport to protect the airplanes"

The teacher got upset said he was "disrespectful" and "talking back" and sent him to the principal's office. I got called and they explained hte situation, that he corrected the teacher. I said "well was he right?" and the principal said "it doesn't matter, this was rude and you need to teach your son show some respect to authority" and I told the principal "I'm not going to punish my son or make him apologize if he was right, maybe your teacher should be better educated"

The principal looked a bit shocked and just told me to leave. Fine by me. Really reconsidering this school.
//
AITA for telling a neighbour she can't expect only old people to live in our street?
**
I moved into my house about 2/3 years ago. I'm 30 (look 20) with a family. It's also a british town and my house is semi detached in a street of terraced houses.

I'm quite the introvert so apart from my direct neighbours I really made no attempt at getting to know the rest around my house. That being said, if someone speaks to me I will happily speak to them.

Cue to the incident, a OAP came up to me while I was taking stuff to my car and she started asking questions. The usual stuff you ask new neighbours but then she asked me when I planned on moving which I thought was quite unusual. I told her I had no plans to move yet and then she went on to talk about how young people have started moving into the street and it is much so noisy, especially those with families (She knew I have kids but they barely spend any time outside) and how she wished it went back to a street of old people.

For about 10 minutes there was nothing but low key insults about young people. I couldn't really excuse myself as I had stuff to do with my car that was time sensitive.

So in the end I just said

"You can't expect only old people to live in a street, eventually they grow old and die. Maybe wait a few years and we'll be old and you'll have your street back if you're still around."

She looked at me as if I just murdered her family and walked off. In the heat of the moment I felt justified but thinking back on it, I pretty much told her she will be dead soon which no one really likes hearing. She just wouldn't stop talking about the good old times.

AITA for letting my toddler destroy 200$?
**
At my 1yo child's birthday some relative gave him 200$. (I) said I'll take it and (R)elative denied. I: don't worry, I spend it on him or put it in his saving account; R: no, i want to give him money myself; I: *surprised pikachu face* that's not the best idea, he will eat it or something; R: but that's his money and i want him to have it. At this point I'm just tired of this fruitless conversation and said sure, go ahead. And then i watched my son grabbing this money, rotate it in his little hands and tear it to pieces in like 3 sec. Relative called me names because "I knew it's gonna happen" and i obviously knew so i couldn't denied. But really is it that shocking, he's 1 for fuck sake and I told her to not give him this money

(On mobile and not native speaker, of course it wasn't 200$ but equivalent in my currency)
//
AITA for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a Japanese downpour?
**
My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

We’re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

AITA for standing by my word and not saving my friend from the rain?
//
AITA for demanding my son take his daughter on his family trip to Disneyland?
**
I got pregnant with my son Julius (28) about a month after my 18th birthday. I tried to do my best for him and he got into a good engineering school but at 19, he got his then girlfriend Iza pregnant and they had Annabella together. I've been the one who has mostly raised her (Iza got deported but they spend July together and FT every night). Julius got married to his girlfriend Katja after graduation and they have two wonderful boys together. Annabella lives with me and not with them.

The thing is, Julius never spends any time with Annabella. He doesn't even call to say goodnight. But she loves him so much. It's like once a month, he'll show up with a box full of toys, spend a day with her and then go back to his family. It hurts her so much that he doesn't spend time with her because he's her hero. I'm just grandma. And no, he doesn't act this way because of his wife. Katja would love to have Annabella move in with them, she once brought up the idea and she went on about all the things they could do together. She would love to be her stepmom, calls her princess, sweetie and so many nice nicknames. The only reason they haven't is because Julius has said she should stay with me.

A few days ago, Julius told me that he and Katja were planning a trip to Disneyland in August. I told him that Annabella would be so excited and he should tell her on her birthday and he just blankly told me she's not coming and the trip is for his boys. I made it clear to him that he needed to bring her on the trip and he just called me an asshole - which he's never done before - for trying to control him. I admit that I was a bit controlling in my reaction but I don't think I went that far.
//
AITA for taking crappy holiday photos because my MIL didn't want me in the photos?
**

I married my wife Lia two months ago. I'm also a woman for the record. Lia's mom seems to have a problem with me, or my sexuality or something, Lia is bi and her mom seems to wish she'd stayed with one of her male exes.

So anyway at Christmas, we were taking photos and her mom was like "OP, we want the photos to be family only.." Lia started to protest, like "we're married, mom" but I didn't want an argument so I said "it's ok, I'll take the pictures." 

It was kind of cringy because lia's sister's husband, and cousin and his wife and son were there so there were definitely spouses and children included

 I was kind of annoyed and decided to not take the best ones... Just on purpose, focused the camera on the furniture rather than people, snapped pictures zoomed in awkwardly close, used unflattering flash, didn't hold my hands steady so they were blurry, took pictures on purpose when someone was looking away or coughing or something.

Anyway I took like 30 pictures and they ranged from bad to horrible. And I gave the camera back and said that I hope they find a nice one to frame in there.

After everything, Lia was angry on my behalf, said her mom had no right to treat me like that and I didn't have to say "it's ok" when it was totally rude. And I just started laughing and told her what I'd done. We snuck down to the dining room later that night and she lost it laughing at the pictures I'd taken. She even deleted some of the more decent ones.

We're still waiting for her mom to plug her camera into the computer and see the pictures. We're planning on saying I tried my best but didn't know how to use a dslr camera if anyone says something

UPDATE: AITA for not giving my friend's dog back unless she pays me for it?
**
[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ic8xq4/aita_for_not_giving_my_friends_dog_back_unless/)

Cindy’s cousin is her lawyer, he told her it would take several months until the case would get seen and she responded that that was way too long and I could just keep the damn dog. I believe her change of heart was somewhat motivated by the fact that she’s met a new boyfriend and doesn’t really have time to take care of Kamu anymore. But Kamu is staying with me, which is all I wanted.

Thank you guys so much for helping me realize that Cindy abandoned Kamu and to not feel bad about keeping her.

AITA for saying "I dunno man, lesbians."?
**
My big sister is my best friend in the entire world. She's literally the coolest, funniest, most fun person I've ever known and she's always been my hero. She's also a lesbian. She's currently engaged to a really really cool lady who I love almost as much as my sister. The wedding is going to be happening in December (lockdown rules dependent of course). 

They've sent out all the invites and stuff. One of my sister's bridesmaids is her current fiancé's ex. They're all friends and quite close so it's not weird for them at all. My sister often makes jokes about how all lesbians know each other and how lesbian relationships tend to work. For example; my girlfriend and I were together a year before we moved in together, and my sister joked that "that's like a decade in Lesbian Years". My girlfriend asked me about the ex being in the wedding party and why they chose to do so cause it seemed like it would be awkward. I said it isn't for them and she asked why. I just shrugged and said "I don't know man, lesbians." 

My girlfriend got pretty mad at me and said that was homophobic and playing into stereotypes and I shouldn't have said it. My sister laughed when I told her but idk, the things my gf said are sticking with me and making me feel pretty bad. What do you lot think?

AITA friend is always late so we give her a earlier time, she actually showed up on time and is pissed
**
Our friend isabel is usually 1-2 hours late to anything we do because she unorganized and spends an excessive amount if time getting ready which she tries to do last minute. We got sick of waiting 1-2 hours every time we go out so wed started telling her to show up at 4 when we are actually meeting at 5:30. We did this like 3 times and she was usually like 10 minutes late still. 

Well here's the problem, we were meeting up last night, we told her 6:30 last night and we were actually meeting at around 7:45. She showed up 25 minutes early and is fucjing pissed that we did this, she found out we gave her wrong times intentionally. She says were assholes and she felt betrayed. I told her it's her own fault for being hours late consistently and it was the only way to get her on time
//
AITA for treating my two daughters' pregnancies differently?
**
When my oldest told me she was pregnant, she was still in college, unemployed and the baby's father was refusing to be involved. I was not thrilled but I provided all the help I could and took care of her. I was having a health crisis at the time so I was very stressed out. I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.

My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. 

My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.

I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.

My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.

She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.

My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.

Am I wrong here?

Update AITA for not allowing my friend to bring her service animal (guide dog) to my wedding?
**

Some of you may remember my post. Well, since I have got married! We decided to get married sooner than we planned because the situation was good where we live and we didn't want to risk having to cancel if numbers spike.

Before, I took your advice and called my friend. I explained how severe my allergies are once again and told her how I really want to be able to enjoy my wedding day. I apologized for making suggestions and not simply asking her and said she is welcome to bring up any ideas that would help her being able to attend (she told me she still wanted to) that do not include her dog. She was adamant that it was her dog or nothing. While disappointed I was prepared for that and told her that would not be possible and that she will be missed at the wedding. 

We sent out the new invitations with the new date and simply didn't invite her so technically she wasn't uninvited.

Some of our mutual friends that are in the wedding told me that she'd asked them not to attend in solidarity but luckily they all thought that was ridiculous.

We had a beautiful wedding and spent our honeymoon in the Flinders Ranges which I can only recommend. 

As for my friend, I'm open to reconciliation but she will have to make the first step.

So that's it. While it didn't go as I hoped it would I'm still in a happy place now enjoying my life as a married woman.

Well I got her to do that and I covered up some of the most significant ones with her drawings.

They have all turned out beautifully and I’m so grateful for the idea. 

I’m working on incorporating my remaining tattoos into a new design, as other people also suggested.

I’m also trying to work through the existing feelings I have regarding my old gang. Mia’s mother has been very supportive regarding all this and our relationship has been a work in progress to. 

It’s been a work in progress but seeing my tattoos turn into something I love has been a very cathartic experience. 

Thanks all.

AITA for telling that I don't give a fuck if she's still mad at me for telling her that she's fat over a year ago?
**
My SIL of five years adopted this new age organic bullshit lifestyle. No one really cared until she started giving unsolicited advice and lectures. My lecture had to with my sweet tooth. Yes, I love Kit Kats. But I don't get cavities, have no health issues, go to the gym four days a week and I don't smoke or drink. I'm about 15lbs overweight and that's not bad for a 40yo man. After one too many lectures about how bad Kit Kats are and how I should replace them with bananas, I casually asked her what her excuse was for being at least 50lbs overweight? I reminded her that like every other post on her social media was her at some restaurant or deli or whatever eating something that I wouldn't even eat. She really didn't have an answer except it's not about calories but what's in the food that counts before running off crying and starting WWIII with my brother. She still hasn't forgiven me and I told her that I don't care. Move on or be gone.

AITA for bluntly telling a woman it’s dangerous to put essential oils in sensitive areas?
**
My uncle’s new girlfriend came to family dinner the other night and it was the first time anyone in my family met her. She is super into essential oils which is very eyeroll inducing for me but I didn’t say anything about it or show that I found it annoying at first. I bit my tongue while she went on about putting them in her water (you should not be ingesting essential oils) and rubbing them on pressure points and trying to convince my mom to buy some. 

But then she brought up that they can be super good for yeast infections!!? I looked at her super horrified and asked “you mean you’re putting them *down there*??” And she said yes you just insert a few drops and it clears up right away! I told her this was very dangerous and could cause chemical burns as well as throwing off your vaginal ph and potentially causing other infections. She said “oh no you don’t have to worry about that they’re all natural!!” To which I replied “so is poison ivy but I wouldn’t suggest shoving it up your vagina.” She just looked kind of shocked. My sister laughed and my aunt said “well she has a point,” but other family members said that it was rude and crass. Which I didn’t think so because she’s the one who started talking about yeast infections at a family dinner certainly saying the word vagina is less crass than that.

AITA for throwing water on a kid who kept doing Ding Dong ditch
**
Due to job opportunities, we recently moved into a new neighborhood. While most things were going fairly smoothly, we'd at around 4pm hear a couple of knocks on our door, when we went to see who it was, to our surprise there wasn't anybody there. It was only until a couple weeks later that we thought there could be the possibility of someone doing ding dong ditch. We just never thought of it as everyone here seemed really relaxed, so ding dong ditch never crossed our minds.


As to not resort to any extreme measures, we put up a sign near the door saying to "please not trouble the peope inside by doing these silly pranks", which didn't work. Since it didn't work, we resorted to asking people about it, but all i got was that it was some sort of tradition for kids in the neighborhood to do this to the new people in the area.

This kind of irked me as ding dong ditch is really annoying so i set up a camera inside our house to capture who was outside our door. 


After reviewing the footage multiple times i was able to confirm it was some brat who was a couple metres away. I went to speak to his parents but they laughed it off saying kids will be kids, so i decided that I'd myself do something about it. After 3 days the kid came back, but i was hiding behind an unlocked door with a large water bucket. As soon as he knocked and turned i opened the door and splashed him with water.

 I thought that was that but, the kids parents came not even 10 mins later, demanding as to why i soaked their kid in water, i tried to justify my reasoning but to no avail.

Im conflicted/feel like an AH as i myself used a petty way of getting that kid to stop annoying us. I would love to hear your opinions on this as well.

AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?
**
So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

AITA for abandoning a grieving friend after she tried to charge me rent?
**
My friend is a recent widow. It's been a long time coming but that hardly makes it easier, her husband passed away at the end of February and she has been understandably distraught since. I have tried my best to support her through this even though I can't possibly understand what she's going through. At the beginning of the March she asked me if I'd stay over during the night because she couldn't stand sleeping alone in an empty house. I obliged and temporarily moved in once I was sure my husband was okay with it. She's not been taking care of herself so I have been doing 100% of the household chores and taking care of her and all her responsibilities as well as working full time. Well last week she spring on me how much she'll be expecting in rent from here on out. She heavily implied I was taking advantage of her in her grief trying to live in her house for free and that she expects me to backpay her rent for the two months I'd already been there. I was extremely insulted by this and told her I'd transfer her the money she wanted but I would be moving back to my own house (where I am also paying rent). I got my stuff and was out within a couple of hours. She has since asked me to come back but I have refused, I told her I'd still do her shopping and I'll come over to help her with a few bits but I'm not spending another night in that house.

AITA for my response to my brother in law's comment about my leg hair?
**


So, my f19, sister, f28 and brother in law came over with the kids for dinner at my parents house. 

I was watching my nieces while dinner was getting ready, we sat down and I happened to sit next to brother in law. I was wearing a skirt and it was accidentally lifted above my knee, my brother in law looked down at my leg and made face then loudly said "Oh shooo, Op! This is gross, you should've shaved, that hair isn't supposed to be there". Everyone stared, I told him "if it's not supposed to be there then why does it grow there, can you explain?" He was like "it's just not supposed to be there", I point at his mustache and say "well, guess the same thing can be said about your little mustache then, huh?". He looks at meeyes wide open, and awkward silence takes over though some laughed. My sister told me to knock it off as my brother in law got up from his chair and went inside the bathroom. My sister followed and I could hear him having a breakdown asking her if there was something wrong with his mustache, my brother and I kept giggling but dinner got cut short cause my brother in law wanted to leave. 

I later got scolded by my sister saying I stepped over the line and disrespected someone who's older than me, who's herhusband and demanded I apologize to him for insulting him and ruining dinner.


AITA?

Edit - Guys! My sister said the reason my brother in law got so offended was because he considers his mustache as a symbol of his "manhood" and so I insulted his "manhood" not just made a "backhanded comment". She said I psychologically harmed him and should apologize for it but I'm not sure if this fixes anything except how he feels about his mustachy mustache.lol.

AITA for leaving a bad review on a small store
**
So my boyfriend and I have a tradition for our anniversary that we each go to a store and separate, and after we buy each other gifts we exchange in the car. It’s silly and cute.

We walked into this new mom & pop anime store (I am a huge anime nerd and my boyfriend likes video games which they also sell)


We separate and I go look at stuff for my boyfriend. A worker walks up to me and starts chatting, then points at my leg. I have a pretty big tattoo of Kakashi from Naruto on my thigh, among other anime tattoos. 

He asks if I got that for my boyfriend and I said no, I’ve always loved Naruto and then showed him my other tattoos which included the leaf village symbol, Gaara of the sands gourd, and a piece on my arm of Asuma Sarutobi.

He started quizzing me on the lore of the anime and I told him I wouldn’t have spent $1000 on tattoos of an anime I didn’t know about, and I didn’t appreciate him trying to catch me in a “Gotcha” moment. 


He told me he didn’t believe a girl could ever fully understand the real story of Naruto and the depth behind it (lol) 


I told him I didn’t need his services and he can go back to the front desk. He told me I was a “rude wannabe bitch” and walked into the back and I continued purchasing my items. 

I left a review later, TLDR: if you’re feminine presenting enter with caution, one of the employees will call you a bitch when you don’t want to prove your “nerd cred” to him. 


The owner left a comment on my review asking for an email conversation and asked that I take down my review because people have started complaining about this employee as well and his sale revenue has dropped. 


I told him I wouldn’t and maybe he shouldn’t hire misogynists if he doesn’t want bad reviews. My friends tell me I’m over reacting.

AITA for refusing to reschedule my birthday party, “forcing” my stepbrother out of “family celebrations” because my stepmom thought I wouldn’t have a party since this isn’t a leap year?
**
I was born on 29th feb 2000, so I’m turning 21 in a few days. My dad got married a month ago. She has a son a few years younger than me. He’s 16. 

My dad is currently abroad for work, and my stepmom decided to take a little holiday out of town with stepbrother. They’re supposed to leave tomorrow, and come back on March 2nd. 

I know my family will throw me a small party. Apparently my grandma reached out to stepmom 2 weeks ago and asked if she’ll be attending. Stepmom freaked out. She told grandma that she didn’t know that I was having a party since there’s no feb 29th this year. Which is the weirdest logic I’ve ever heard anyone use. Do you think I only celebrate every four years? 

She’s angry because she’s already booked the holiday, and cancelling it would be really expensive. This would be the first family gathering (yup, my party would be the first time my close family gathers in around a year. We still need to keep it under 15 people though) and stepbrother won’t be there to enjoy etc. 

She asked grandma whether it could be shifted to March 3rd. Grandma called me and asked me if that would be okay. I’m not okay with that. 

March 3rd isn’t a weekend. The party is currently scheduled for 28th of this month, which is a Sunday so most of my aunts and uncles can make it. They can’t make it on March 3rd. I’d prefer my aunts and uncles who I’m close to vs stepmom I met for the first time last month. 

I told her no. Stepmom is super upset that her son won’t meet his family and they don’t know they next time there’ll be a family gathering like this. 

My dad is staying out of this. He has the very convenient excuse of not being in the country to ignore this argument.

AITA for “tattling” on my boyfriend to his mother
**
My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He’ll sit on the couch and play video games and he’ll only tend to her while she’s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I’m in the middle of doing something right then, he’ll ask me why I can’t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he’s watching tv and she’s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won’t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We’ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I’ve told him I can’t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

I’m honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn’t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what’s going on.

She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he’s upset with me for involving his mother and for “taking a video out of context.” I’m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?

Edit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it.

AITA for keeping tampons/pads in a basket for my students?
**
Hey everyone!

I'm 38M. I'm a father of two daughters and I teach high schoolers here in CA. Since we started off the school year recently I've been noticing our female students have been having some "issues" and it's hard for them to have/find tampons/pads etc when they need it.

As a father myself, I understand that those are essentials for woman. So same thing what I do with my daughters. I bought a bunch of tampons/pads and placed it in a basket in our class so our female students can grab one at any time and it's convenient for them. the whole class loves it. Nobody says anything and overall it's helpful for our students.

Now my colleague teacher next-door who's name is Susan she's like 60F. She thinks it's inapropriate that I have that for my female students and she told me it's weird because I'm a male. I don't find it weird or anything. Cause there isn't anything weird about it? what's wrong with a period or so nothing. It's natural and it happens. To make it convenient for my students I made the basket and they love it and I also refill the basket on a constant basis.

EDIT: some kind redditors, are sending me messages asking my Venmo so I can buy more pads/tampons for the class. First off thank you so much. But I don't need the money! It's all good. I make a good living from teaching here in CA.  so buying pads/tampons isn't expensive for me. But I appreciate it :) 
//
AITA for grounding my 16yro son for a month after he called his stepdad a slur?
**
I'm 43M, my son is 16M. I'm divorced (have been for a few years now) and my ex remarried recently. 

Her new husband (Jonathan) is black (we're white). He and my ex are now expecting a baby together. He also has 2 teenage boys himself. 

My ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. 

Last weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but "no video games today" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. 

My ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to " f*ck off". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied "you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway". 

I asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because "well isnt it true"). 

I lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. 

He said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

AITA for insisting my boyfriend eat respectfully at a nice restaurant?
**
So my boyfriend (20M), L, and I (20F) have been dating for 7 months. We usually eat take out if we want to get something to eat. However, I recently was promoted so we went to eat at a VERY nice Italian restaurant to celebrate. Like, one with an enforced dress code. 

My boyfriend is not the nicest of eaters, which can be kind of gross but I deal with it. However, I didn’t realize he had no table manners. At the restaurant, after we were served our first appetizer, a beautifully plated bruschetta dish, L looked at me and jokingly asked me if I would be upset if he enjoyed his meal the same way he would at home. I told him that we were at a nice restaurant and there were other customers around. 

He didn’t say anything, but instead started digging into the bruschetta with his hands, ignoring the serving fork, getting sauce all over his fingers. I let this go. However, when the pasta came out, he smirked at me and ate like he hadn’t eaten in a week. 

He dropped his fork and started picking up pieces of chicken and noodles with his fingers, getting sauce everywhere: the tablecloth, his hands, his clothes and face. He didn’t miss the opportunity to loudly burp after he had finished destroying his side of the table. The table next to us was astonished. My waiter even asked him if he was ok. Other customers were staring. He also put his feet up on the chair next to us, blocking the aisle. 

I had no idea what to do. I didn’t want to make even more of a scene so I just asked for the check (which I paid) and left really embarrassed. On the way home I told him how embarrassed I was and he just said that it was my fault for not letting him enjoy the meal as he pleased and that since we were paying customers the other guests had no business judging us.

AITA for refusing to babysit my sister's kids any further after her son lied to her about me?
**
My sister is a single mother with 2 children. An 11, and 7 year old. The 7 year old is a boy while the other 1 is a girl. She works a lot, and doesn't have a lot of money to afford babysitting, so I started watching her kids for her for free. 

There was an incident one day where the 7 year old had gotten mad at me because I wouldn't let him jump on the couch. I explained to him he could get hurt, and he threw a tantrum. Which was normal, its what young kids do. Well around the time my sister gets home he starts suddenly bawling his eyes out and running towards her. I'm confused, as he was just fine a second ago but followed behind him to greet her. 

He immediately starts on a rant about how I had a man in the house, and how neither him or his sister had eaten at all that day. My sister was rightfully pissed, and started asking questions. I shook my head, said he was lying, and that she had cameras so we should probably sit down and watch them. She said no, and that I needed to go before she called the police. 

So I left. A few hours later she calls me and apologizes, saying she watched the footage and saw no man enter the house at all, and that she had seen that her son had refused to eat the dinner I made them. She asked when could I come by next, as she hoped I understood the misunderstanding, but I said I would no longer be babysitting for her.

She said that he's just 7, and that kids lie all the time but I still refused. We went back and forth over the phone insulting each other, and that was that. Our mother thinks I'm being ridiculous for being mad at a kid, but it's more than that. I could've gotten in trouble if the police had shown up and he was saying what he said.  AITA?
//
AITA for refusing to change my necklace?
**
I have worn a necklace for the last ten years. My friend, who is pagan, gave it to me as a gift when we first met. This friend passed away last year. The necklace is a pentagram. 

I do not believe it has magic. I am agnostic. I do not believe in any religion being better than another, because I don't think any religion is right. But I keep this to myself. I just like the necklace and my friend was/is important to me. It is the only jewelry I wear.

I recently met my brother (Måns) for dinner and he introduced his girlfriend Eva (early 30s). She is Christian. She believes in very many things I do not. 

She was very polite, but my brother told me she was uncomfortable. He said she comes from a culture where those things are evil. She does not want it in her life. 

I said I am not evil. I am wearing a star. It is rude. I did not ask her to take off her crucifix, which had a dead man nailed on it. Which creeps me out a little. 

He told me that Eva would be coming to dinner next Sunday. It would be at our parents' home. They do not believe either. Måns asked them to please talk to me. They said no. In their home I will wear what I like. They have said they would not pray either, like Måns has asked. 

Our sister Greta has asked Måns not to bring around someone ignorant. 

Måns is mad at me for not removing the necklace. I believe that it is not evil, that saying someone is evil because of a star is wrong. And I do not like his girlfriend for demanding suck things.

AITA for giving the PS5 my Husband bought to my Nephew?
**
I am a 35 year old woman and my husband is 37, I discovered the other day he had bought a PS5 as a gift for himself, but the thing is he used *my* money to do so without my permission using a portion of my emergency savings that he had access to in case of you know, an emergency. Which I do not believe being able to get your hands on a new video game console classes as.

This led to a huge argument and I took the console away and reboxed it up, I debated on returning it to the shop for the money but I know my  sister has been struggling to find one for my 13 year old Nephew for over a year, so instead I wrapped it up and took it round to hers and put it under the tree and quietly explained what it was and what had happened, my sister then gave me the money for it. 

My husband went *ballistic* shouting and demanding I go get it back which I of course refused to do, telling him as it had been bought with my money it was my choice what happened to it. He is now sulking and refusing to talk to me and acting like a huge child.

Edit: For anyone curious about our money situation and why i'm so angry, we each put half our salary into a communal family fund for the house, bills, groceries etc. The other half is ours to play with as we want, my husband always blows through his and never saves a penny, half of my expendable money goes into savings for emergencies as i'm more realistic.

Second Edit: Stating here because of comments, He refused to pay me back as it was an "emergency"

Third Edit: I have emptied the emergency account that he has access to and put it all in my personal account that he does not have access to, including the money I got from my sister for the ps5.

AITA for saying it’s a little embarrassing that a girl’s nanny puts little notes in her lunch
**
So, this girl, Nicole(16), started going to my (16f) school after winter break. She’s a little weird tbh. She doesn’t talk a lot and when she does talk, she’s so quiet that you can barely hear her. 

She used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she’d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she’d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch.

I eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that’s a little embarrassing because I don’t know anyone who’s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade. 

She got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point. 

She started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she’s never had anyone do that stuff for her. Idk how tf she expected me to know, considering she usually only talks about school but it’s starting some drama in my friend group so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.

AITA for leaving my boyfriend stranded at a party for making a 'joke'?
**
I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for about 6 months. We don't live together, but I spend a lot of my time at his place. 

A week ago or so I was feeling quite sick. Not wanting to drive home, I spend the night at his place. He woke me up at about 5 am, and to my great embarrassment, I had wet the bed. I helped him clean up the best I could. I had a temp of about 103.8 F and he took me to the hospital, they kept me overnight. 

A few days later when I saw him again I apologised for what happened. He told me it's alright, and that he got me a gift. He pulled out a package of adult diapers and threw them at me. I told him that I didn't think it was very funny and explained that I was embarrassed, but he thought it was hilarious. I decided to let it go and talk about it later. 

We went to a party that night (not really a 'party', us and 6 other friends), about an hour away. I drove, since he doesn't have a car. 

After he had a few beers he started loudly telling them what had happened, 'forgetting' to mention that I was sick and had a high fever, just the part of me wetting the bed and him buying the diapers. He encouraged my friends to joke about it, and after trying to explain but being talked over or laughed at, I left and went home. 

My boyfriend is obviously quite upset I left without him, I just didn't want to be stuck in a car with him for an hour. He sent me several texts since then, most of which are calling me too sensitive and 'not able to take a joke'. Some of my friends agree with him.

AITA for kicking my SIL out for eating my order?
**


My husband's sister moved in with us after a major argument about the baby's name (they're expecting and she's 7 months in!). she's known be picky and refuses to eat what what we normally cook.

We only cook her favorite food, which I can't eat (allergies yay!!) Everyday at dinner I have to figure out what to eat since she only eats food that I'm allergic to.


Last night, My husband agreed that he'd cook for her and cook for us together seperately. I got home after a long day at work and found out that SIL convinced my husband to only cook the meal she wanted and cancel on the meal we planned to have. I saw them eating together in the kitchen. My husband apologitically said his sister convinced him to eat with her and not cook the meal I wanted us both to have. I said it was FINE then went to order some food from the restaurant.


I went to take a shower and did some work on my laptop then came downstairs to find my order placed on the kitchen counter. It was open and someone ate the majority of it. I turned around and there was SIL standing saying she woke up hungry and couldn't "resist" the smell that was coming out of the box. I lost it and yelled at her asking wtf she did that but she said that she did save me some which isn't true because there was only some rice and dressings. We started arguing and I told her I couldn't take this anymore and told her to pack her shit and leave first thing in the morning. She began crying and my husband got involved and defended her up and down repeatedly saying she's pregnant and is eating for 2 basically. He suggested I go make myself something quick from the fridge and let it go but I refused and a bigger argument ensued.

WIBTA for taking my friend's ex as my date to her wedding after I got kicked out of her wedding party?
**
My friend is marrying my ex boyfriend of four years. It's been pretty awkward. I was kicked out of her wedding party because I was uncomfortable wearing a very revealing bridesmaid's gown. This wasn't that big of a deal as we're not exactly close since she got with my ex. However, she still expects me to take on all the duties of a bridesmaid. I told her that was ridiculous and that she needed to find a new bridesmaid. She then almost uninvited me from the wedding but instead decided I could go I follow a very specific set of rules (ranging from how to dress to who I could talk to). I was absolutely crushed as I was still looking forward to the wedding even if I wasn't going to be in it. I found out through a mutual friend who is still in the wedding party the bride continuously makes fun of me and talks shit about me constantly and so do several of the other bridesmaids. I was about to just not go when I ran into the bride's ex who is also invited to the wedding (He's the groom's cousin). He was also kicked out of the wedding party and was given a list of rules to follow. He and I have decided we're going to go together and have fun breaking as many rules that we can (such as wearing what we want to wear, drinking at the open bar, talking to whoever we want to, and dancing- WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DANCE). Nothing we would do would distract from the bride's big day other than breaking the ridiculously petty rules that we're supposed to follow. We're also both at the point where we're both ready to sever ties with the bride and groom. Would we be the assholes? Sorry if this was scattered, a lot happened in the past month and her wedding is in three weeks. Thanks in advance, I'm willing to accept my judgement!

AITA for only feeding one child frozen food
**
My son is Indian, and his friend, who is White, are both 9. My son brought his friend over after school on the bus. I messaged his mom and asked if this was okay and how late he was staying. She asked if he could stay until 10. I serve dinner around 8, so he would be eating with us. I cook a lot of Indian cuisine in my house because that's what I grew up making. My son told me his friend was picky and asked if I could make him something else. I keep fries and chicken nuggets for when my son has picky friends over. So we all sit to eat, and my son's friend seems happy with the nuggets, and they go to play after dinner. The boy's mom picks him up a little after 9. I get a text later asking why I fed her son frozen food when I cooked a fresh dinner for everyone else. I told her my son said the boy wouldn’t eat what I was making. She said I should have made him something also instead of just getting freezer food. I told her I provided free childcare without notice, and her kid chose not to eat what everyone else ate. I continued that when I was a child, my mom didn’t offer anyone alternatives to what was made, so he’s lucky I accommodated him. She told me she wouldn’t let her son stay with a child abuser anymore.

AITA for singing a song to my wife at our wedding and making her angry?
**
I just got married last week (my wife and I are both in our thirties). I am Mexican, she is American, but we both grew up in the US and both our families know both languages. My wife planned every bit of the wedding and was a very controlling and nervous bride, but alright, I get that she was stressed. 

During the reception I went to the band and asked them to play a song for me to sing to my new wife. It was Te Amare by Miguel Bose. It was the song from out first date in a really bad Mexican restaurant, so it became a long standing joke between us. 

The guests really loved the song, my MIL cried and told me it was beautiful, but my bride seemed upset. I asked her what's wrong and she said I am an AH for taking the spotlight to enforce my ethnicity and not just let the band sing our song for us. Aita?
