She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.\n\nThen she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. \n\nI told her I never gave her permission to do those things.

Conversation progressed further into me finding out she could not point out AUSTRALIA either. I was visibly astonished at this revelation and essentially said \"...are you kidding.\" She immediately got defensive calling me an asshole for making her feel stupid.
